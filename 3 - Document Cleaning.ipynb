Balance sheet runoff begins in June; an eventual monthly cap will be set at $95bn—split $60bn-$35bn between US Treasury and mortgage- backed securities (MBS)—and the caps will initially be set at half of those levels for the first three months of runoff ($30bn UST-$17.5bn MBS). \n Balance sheet size: 37% of GDP \n We expect a 50bps rate hike in September followed by a reversion to 25bps rate hikes.  \n Slightly hawkish \n ECB  Deposit facility rate: 0.0% \n Last changed: July 2022 (+50bps), the first hike since 2011 \n The ECB will end net APP purchases from July 1, 2022. Reinvestments under the PEPP will continue until at least the end of 2024. On July 21, the ECB announced a new anti-fragmentation tool, the Transmission Protection Instrument (TPI), used to ensure monetary policy is transmitted smoothly across all euro area countries.
