Each investor should carefully consider the risks associated with the investment and make a determination based upon the investor’s own particular circumstances, that the investment is consistent with the investor’s investment objectives.

 Important Disclosure on High Yield Bonds  
 Unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities typically offer a higher yield than investment grade Debt Securities, but also present greater risks with respect to liquidity, volatility, and non-payment of principal and interest. As a result of being classified as non investment grade Debt Securities, these Debt Securities present a greater degree of credit risk relative to many other fixed income Debt Securities. Higher Credit Risk – Unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities generally have predominantly speculative characteristics with respect to the issuer’s capacity to pay interest and repay principal. There is greater risk of non-payment of interest and loss of principal. Many issuers of these Debt Securities have experienced substantial difficulties in servicing their debt obligations, which has led to default and restructurings. The issuers of these Debt Securities generally have to pay a higher rate of interest than investment grade Debt Securities. Higher Liquidity and Secondary Market Risk – The markets in which unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities are traded are generally more limited than those in which investment grade Debt Securities are traded. This lack of liquidity may make it more difficult to resell these Debt Securities and obtain market quotations. Downgrade Risk – Downgrades in the credit rating of unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities by rating agencies are generally accompanied by declines in the market value of these Debt Securities. In some circumstances, investors in the unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities market may anticipate such downgrades as a result of these credits being placed on “credit watch” by rating agencies, causing volatility and speculation of further credit deterioration. Higher Vulnerability to economic cycles - During economic downturns, unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities are typically more susceptible to price volatility and fall more in value than investment grade Debt Securities as i) investors may reevaluate holdings in lower-quality bonds in favor of investment-grade corporate Debt Securities; ii) investors become more risk averse; and iii) default risk rises.  This is often referred to a “flight to quality”. Event Risk – This includes any of a variety of events that can adversely affect the issuer of unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities, and therefore the issuer’s ability to meet debt service obligations to repay principal and interest to Debt Securities holders. Event risk may pertain to the issuer specifically, the industry or business sector of the issuer, or generally upon the overall economy. It could have a direct or indirect impact on the issuer and their outstanding debts. 
 Important Disclosure on RMB 
 Risk relating to RMB – If you choose RMB as the base currency or the alternate currency, you should also note the following: RMB is currently not freely convertible through banks in Hong Kong. Due to exchange controls and/or restrictions imposed on the convertibility, utilization or transferability of RMB (if any) which in turn is affected by, amongst other things, the PRC government's control, there is no guarantee that disruption in the transferability, convertibility or liquidity of RMB will not occur. There is thus a likelihood that you may not be able to convert RMB received into other freely convertible currencies. CNH exchange rates and CNY exchange rates are currently quoted in different markets with different exchange rates, whereby their exchange rate movements may not be in the same direction or magnitude. Therefore, the CNH exchange rate may be different from the CNY exchange rate.

 POLICY PICTURE 
 The Fed appears to have concluded the “expeditious” phase of its tightening cycle, delivering a 75bps rate hike to take the policy rate to their own neutral estimate of 2.25- 2.5%. Markets responded favourably in anticipation of a slower pace of tightening ahead (see Chart) given a loss of growth momentum, emerging signs of easing inflation pressures and the Fed’s emphasis on data dependence going forward (see quote).  
 Overall, we think the outlook for Fed policy has turned more balanced. We expect a further rate increase in September, with the hike increment being guided by key data releases such as the employment cost index, PCE inflation and measures of consumer inflation expectations. Thereafter, we think signs of softening in both the labour market and inflation outturns could see the Fed pause to assess the impact of this year’s rapid tightening. After all, the Fed has raised rates by 2.25% in just five months.   
 Notwithstanding the growing accumulation of evidence on weaker growth prospects for the second half of the year, policymakers appear to be retaining a glass-half-full assessment of the economy. During the post-meeting press conference Fed Chair Jerome Powell said he does not think the US is currently in recession as “there are just too many areas of the economy that are performing too well.” Meanwhile, US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen highlighted the creation of almost 400,000 jobs a month “is not a recession” and that a recession would require a “broad- based weakening of the economy” which is inconsistent with recent data.  
 Past performance does not guarantee future results, which may vary. The economic and market forecasts presented herein are for informational purposes as of the date of this presentation. There can be no assurance that the forecasts will be achieved. Please see additional disclosures at the end of this presentation.

 July 29, 2022 
 MACRO AT A GLANCE 
 Economic data has turned more mixed and is not consistently supportive of rapid monetary tightening. For example, flash composite PMI readings for July were in contractionary territory in the US and Euro Area (see Chart). Weakness on the services side of the economy likely reflects the cost-of-living crisis and indicates the post- Omicron rebound is behind us.  
 In Europe, high inflation continues to weigh on sentiment with the German ifo Business Climate index falling to its lowest level since June 2020. Meanwhile, the US economy experienced its second consecutive quarter of negative GDP growth. With nonfarm payroll growth averaging 375,000 during the second quarter and GDP data subject to revisions, we do not think the economy was in a recession in the first half of the year, however, we acknowledge risks are building.  
 NAVIGATING FIXED INCOME 
 A “bad news is good news” dynamic has emerged whereby signs of slowing growth and easing inflation pressures provides some relief for markets due to reduced risks of policy overtightening. That said, within fixed income sectors, bouts of weakness in lower-quality bonds reflects growing growth concerns (see Chart).  
 We used recent strength in high yield corporate credit as an opening to scale back our exposure. Overall, we remain overweight corporate bonds given continued strength in corporate balance sheet positions. However, we are mindful of downbeat signals from second quarter earnings releases, including signs of slowing consumer demand owing to inflation pressures.  
 Past performance does not guarantee future results, which may vary. The economic and market forecasts presented herein are for informational purposes as of the date of this presentation. There can be no assurance that the forecasts will be achieved. Please see additional disclosures at the end of this presentation.

 Fed  Federal funds rate: 2.25%-2.50%  
 Last changed:  
 July 2022 (+75bps) Prior changes: 
 June 2022 (+75bps) 
 May 2022 (+50bps) 
 March 2022 (+25bps) 
 Started reducing the monthly pace of its net asset purchases in November 2021 and ended net additional purchases of Treasuries and agency MBS in early March. Balance sheet runoff begins in June; an eventual monthly cap will be set at $95bn—split $60bn-$35bn between US Treasury and mortgage- backed securities (MBS)—and the caps will initially be set at half of those levels for the first three months of runoff ($30bn UST-$17.5bn MBS). 
 Balance sheet size: 37% of GDP 
 We expect a 50bps rate hike in September followed by a reversion to 25bps rate hikes.  
 Slightly hawkish 
 ECB  Deposit facility rate: 0.0% 
 Last changed: July 2022 (+50bps), the first hike since 2011 
 The ECB will end net APP purchases from July 1, 2022. Reinvestments under the PEPP will continue until at least the end of 2024. On July 21, the ECB announced a new anti-fragmentation tool, the Transmission Protection Instrument (TPI), used to ensure monetary policy is transmitted smoothly across all euro area countries. Balance sheet size: 65% of GDP 
 We expect a 50bps hike in September and two further 25bps rate hikes at the October and December meetings.  
 Slightly dovish  
 BoE  Bank Rate: 1.25%  
 Last changed: June 2022 (+25bps) 
 Prior changes: 
 May 2022 (+25bps) March 2022 (+25bps) 
 February 2022 (+25bps) 
 December 2021 (+15bps) 
 BoE members voted in February 2022 to begin to reduce the stock of UK government bond purchases by ceasing to reinvest maturing assets, as well as to begin to reduce the stock of sterling non-financial investment grade corporate bond purchases by ceasing to reinvest maturing assets and by a program of corporate bond sales.  
 Balance sheet size: 30% of GDP 
 We think the BoE will hike rates further to 1.75% before pausing its hiking cycle.  
 We expect the BoE to commence bond sales at their September meeting.  
 Slightly dovish 
 BoJ  Policy deposit rate: -0.10%  
 Last changed: January 2016, when the Bank introduced its negative interest rate policy (NIRP)  
 10-year JGB yield target: ~0%, with tolerance band of - /+25bp (yield curve control policy) 
 The Bank voted in January 2021 to purchase ETFs and Japanese REITs as necessary with upper limits of ~¥12tn and ~¥180bn, respectively, on annual paces of increase in their outstanding amounts, as well as to purchase commercial paper and corporate bonds with an upper limit on the outstanding amount of ~¥20tn in total until the end of March. 
 Balance sheet size: 135% of GDP 
 We expect unchanged policies through 2022 but see scope for a rate hike in 2023. 
 Slightly dovish

Each investor should carefully consider the risks associated with the investment and make a determination based upon the investor’s own particular circumstances, that the investment is consistent with the investor’s investment objectives.

 Important Disclosure on High Yield Bonds  
 Unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities typically offer a higher yield than investment grade Debt Securities, but also present greater risks with respect to liquidity, volatility, and non-payment of principal and interest. As a result of being classified as non investment grade Debt Securities, these Debt Securities present a greater degree of credit risk relative to many other fixed income Debt Securities. Higher Credit Risk – Unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities generally have predominantly speculative characteristics with respect to the issuer’s capacity to pay interest and repay principal. There is greater risk of non-payment of interest and loss of principal. Many issuers of these Debt Securities have experienced substantial difficulties in servicing their debt obligations, which has led to default and restructurings. The issuers of these Debt Securities generally have to pay a higher rate of interest than investment grade Debt Securities. Higher Liquidity and Secondary Market Risk – The markets in which unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities are traded are generally more limited than those in which investment grade Debt Securities are traded. This lack of liquidity may make it more difficult to resell these Debt Securities and obtain market quotations. Downgrade Risk – Downgrades in the credit rating of unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities by rating agencies are generally accompanied by declines in the market value of these Debt Securities. In some circumstances, investors in the unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities market may anticipate such downgrades as a result of these credits being placed on “credit watch” by rating agencies, causing volatility and speculation of further credit deterioration. Higher Vulnerability to economic cycles - During economic downturns, unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities are typically more susceptible to price volatility and fall more in value than investment grade Debt Securities as i) investors may reevaluate holdings in lower-quality bonds in favor of investment-grade corporate Debt Securities; ii) investors become more risk averse; and iii) default risk rises.  This is often referred to a “flight to quality”. Event Risk – This includes any of a variety of events that can adversely affect the issuer of unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities, and therefore the issuer’s ability to meet debt service obligations to repay principal and interest to Debt Securities holders. Event risk may pertain to the issuer specifically, the industry or business sector of the issuer, or generally upon the overall economy. It could have a direct or indirect impact on the issuer and their outstanding debts. 
 Important Disclosure on RMB 
 Risk relating to RMB – If you choose RMB as the base currency or the alternate currency, you should also note the following: RMB is currently not freely convertible through banks in Hong Kong. Due to exchange controls and/or restrictions imposed on the convertibility, utilization or transferability of RMB (if any) which in turn is affected by, amongst other things, the PRC government's control, there is no guarantee that disruption in the transferability, convertibility or liquidity of RMB will not occur. There is thus a likelihood that you may not be able to convert RMB received into other freely convertible currencies. CNH exchange rates and CNY exchange rates are currently quoted in different markets with different exchange rates, whereby their exchange rate movements may not be in the same direction or magnitude. Therefore, the CNH exchange rate may be different from the CNY exchange rate.

 • The unexpected 25bp hike with more to come now places the RBA as potentially one of the more hawkish central banks within the G10 central bank space with a greater capacity to lift rates than its peers (RBNZ or BoC). This leaves the 0.6550 –0.6600 area very well supported in AUDUSD. 
 • Implicit in the robust medium to longer-term view on AUD is the prospect of a highly de- synchronized business cycle in H2’23 as the US heads towards recession while China’s recovery strengthens. This puts AUD on track for further medium to longer-term outperformance vs USD, NZD, CAD and GBP.

 NZD Citi views & strategy Bias/ Forecasts/ Key levels 
 Citi FX outlook 
 NZD outperformance earlier due to its higher carry looks unsustainable as –(1) current highly restrictive NZ financial conditions sharply raise the prospect of a hard landing for the NZ economy; (2) the recent larger 50bp hike sharply reduces odds of further RBNZ tightening; and (3) a strengthening Chinese recovery better supports other currencies closely linked to China (EUR, AUD, SGD, CNH). Against USD however, the combination of a stronger Chinese recovery in H2’23 and Fed pivoting towards rate cuts may yet lift NZDUSD in H2’23.

Combined with our EURUSD view of 1.16 in 6- 12m, this should feed into AUDUSD upside.

 BoJ YCC shift remains in play. Citi analysts’ base case is for shortening of the target duration from 10y to 5y or 3y in June meeting (after final outcome of spring wage negotiations). For US, as more hikes are priced, total cycle cuts are likely to deepen. Even in the scenario of a hawkish Fed, we think it may be hard for US duration to sell-off too much, but if things gets worse, it has a lot further to rally. This also makes JPY an asymmetric bet.

 USD and EM Currency 
 USD Citi views & strategy Bias/ Forecasts/ Key levels 
 Citi FX outlook 
 USD signals almost uniformly bearish. Rates volatility has dropped sharply in recent weeks, triggering a more benign macro backdrop. Elsewhere, global growth dynamics are picking up (RoW LEIs 3m change turning positive from depressed levels), and US nominal rate momentum and data momentum is also negative vs G9. Finally, the USD is still historically overvalued, and a bull steepening US 2s10s curve is also the most bearish USD backdrop.

A more tactically range-bound USDCNH in H1’2023 within a 6.80 –7.00 range with a drift to the lower end of the range possible by the end of Q2 (on USD weakness) with scope to target the 6.50 –70 range in H2’2023 as Fed pivots towards rate cuts while China’s domestic recovery gathers pace.

 Important Disclosure on High Yield Bonds  
 Unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities typically offer a higher yield than investment grade Debt Securities, but also present greater risks with respect to liquidity, volatility, and non-payment of principal and interest. As a result of being classified as non investment grade Debt Securities, these Debt Securities present a greater degree of credit risk relative to many other fixed income Debt Securities. Higher Credit Risk – Unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities generally have predominantly speculative characteristics with respect to the issuer’s capacity to pay interest and repay principal. There is greater risk of non-payment of interest and loss of principal. Many issuers of these Debt Securities have experienced substantial difficulties in servicing their debt obligations, which has led to default and restructurings. The issuers of these Debt Securities generally have to pay a higher rate of interest than investment grade Debt Securities. Higher Liquidity and Secondary Market Risk – The markets in which unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities are traded are generally more limited than those in which investment grade Debt Securities are traded. This lack of liquidity may make it more difficult to resell these Debt Securities and obtain market quotations. Downgrade Risk – Downgrades in the credit rating of unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities by rating agencies are generally accompanied by declines in the market value of these Debt Securities. In some circumstances, investors in the unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities market may anticipate such downgrades as a result of these credits being placed on “credit watch” by rating agencies, causing volatility and speculation of further credit deterioration. Higher Vulnerability to economic cycles - During economic downturns, unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities are typically more susceptible to price volatility and fall more in value than investment grade Debt Securities as i) investors may reevaluate holdings in lower-quality bonds in favor of investment-grade corporate Debt Securities; ii) investors become more risk averse; and iii) default risk rises.  This is often referred to a “flight to quality”. Event Risk – This includes any of a variety of events that can adversely affect the issuer of unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities, and therefore the issuer’s ability to meet debt service obligations to repay principal and interest to Debt Securities holders. Event risk may pertain to the issuer specifically, the industry or business sector of the issuer, or generally upon the overall economy. It could have a direct or indirect impact on the issuer and their outstanding debts. 
 Important Disclosure on RMB 
 Risk relating to RMB – If you choose RMB as the base currency or the alternate currency, you should also note the following: RMB is currently not freely convertible through banks in Hong Kong. Due to exchange controls and/or restrictions imposed on the convertibility, utilization or transferability of RMB (if any) which in turn is affected by, amongst other things, the PRC government's control, there is no guarantee that disruption in the transferability, convertibility or liquidity of RMB will not occur. There is thus a likelihood that you may not be able to convert RMB received into other freely convertible currencies. CNH exchange rates and CNY exchange rates are currently quoted in different markets with different exchange rates, whereby their exchange rate movements may not be in the same direction or magnitude. Therefore, the CNH exchange rate may be different from the CNY exchange rate.

 We have become accustomed to uncertain times. Nonetheless, 2022 was an extremely challenging year in financial markets. The investment rationale for the classic 60% stocks / 40% bonds portfolio is that it will deliver solid if not spectacular returns. As of October, the 60/40 portfolio was on track to match its worst year for performance since the Second World War.  
 Sharply rising bond yields were a key reason. They weighed on ultra-long duration assets like equities, with the Nasdaq down almost 30% year-to-date. Beyond 60/40, we saw major rotations in style with value stocks bucking the trend of recent years and outperforming growth. In currency markets, the US dollar surged and the Japanese yen had a year to forget. 
 Navigating geopolitical tensions has increasingly become an occupational hazard for investors. The conflict in Ukraine has had a profound impact on global commodity prices, amplifying inflation, and forcing Europe to re-think its energy policies. This will have major implications for industry structure and living standards for years to come. Meanwhile, markets are watching Sino-US relations closely, fearful that tensions over Taiwan could escalate.  
 No doubt 2023 will bring fresh sources of volatility. But that volatility should be seen as an opportunity for an active manager. It is our job to make sense of the evolving macroeconomic landscape, position accordingly, and translate the market moves into strong performance for our clients. We remain convinced that a relentless focus on sustainability is an essential ingredient within that investment process and we do not accept that there is a conflict between delivering strong performance for clients and embedding sustainability in everything we do. On the contrary, we view sustainable investing as an opportunity, rather than a constraint. We have just published  Committed to climate: Our net zero roadmap  which spells out how we will align our portfolios with the goal of reaching net zero emissions. I hope that you will remain partners with us on the journey to net zero investing.

 Executive summary 
 In our 2023 Investment Outlook, we seek to guide investors at a pivotal moment for the global economy. We live in an age of transformation, with surging inflation and fundamental geopolitical shifts leading to rising demands on governments.  
 A sustainable recovery  In the terms of the progressing green transformation, we believe that, as investors, we must continue to focus our resources on sustainable long-term growth. We see opportunities in the shift leading to, for example, green hydrogen, restoring natural capital or building green infrastructure.  
 Investment themes for the long run  Our themes have both a sustainable angle – energy transition and environmental sustainability – and a focus on enduring trends. These trends include innovation and disruption via new technology, the appeal of private markets and the emergence of China. While any significant re-rating of China A-shares may be unlikely now, valuations appear attractive and argue for strategic positioning. Opportunities include consumption upgrading and hard-tech development.  
 Macroeconomics and markets  These sections highlight that: • The global economy is on the brink of recession as policy rates shoot higher, Europe faces an energy shock, and China struggles with zero-Covid policies and fragile property markets. • The Chinese government has scope to stimulate growth, but in the West, government measures to aid households and companies may undermine central bank inflation-busting. • Equities face a struggle to generate above-average returns, even as the disconnect between still relatively optimistic corporate earnings expectations and economic reality narrows. We are neutral, with deep caution in Europe offset by optimism for US growth stocks. • Within fixed income, eurozone investment-grade credit offers the most attractive opportunity with wide spreads, but generally good corporate fundamentals.

 The global economy seems on an inevitable march towards recession. The causes are well-known: central banks aggressively raising policy rates to reduce inflation, an energy shock in Europe, and zero-Covid policies (ZCP) and a shaky property market in China.  
 Much of Europe is already in recession. We expect one to begin in the US in the third quarter of 2023, and while China’s growth will likely not turn negative, it will be below historic levels.  
 One can easily think of ways in which the situation could yet worsen: a breakdown in a key financial market due to the rapid rise in interest rates, a cold winter and blackouts in Europe, or a flare-up in geopolitical tensions between the US and China.  
 US  Given the strength of the US labour market, reflected not only in a low unemployment rate, but also in high (nominal) wage gains, declines in non-farm payrolls in 2023 will likely be necessary. Consumer demand will weaken, even though households still have a large amount of ‘excess’ savings. These savings are falling and, we should note, are concentrated among high-income/low-consumption households.  
 A deterioration of the labour market will be key to bringing services inflation under control. Goods inflation should drop thanks to base effects and lower demand, while

 shelter costs will eventually reflect the ongoing slowdown in the housing market. We anticipate core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation will fall below 3% by the end of 2023.  
 One open question is whether wage inflation can be reduced without a large increase in unemployment. The number of job vacancies relative to the size of the labour force is still about twice the long-run average 1 , meaning companies are forced to raise wages to attract workers (see Exhibit 1). Historically, vacancies only decline significantly when the unemployment rate rises. The US Federal Reserve believes that the currently high number of vacancies reflects the reorganisation of the labour market and the economy following the pandemic. As that process ends, vacancies could fall without the unemployment rate necessarily rising.  
 There is another reason to believe the unemployment rate may not rise very much. US companies have learned from the lockdown recession that firing employees may reduce costs in the short term, but it creates problems later on. They may move towards a more European model, where employees are kept on the payroll through a recession, allowing for a swifter and smoother recovery later. 
 Offsetting the drag from higher policy rates will be the ongoing investments triggered by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, and the Inflation Reduction Act, which will direct nearly USD 400 billion in tax credits and subsidies for numerous clean energy programmes.

 Eurozone  Europe is facing an energy shock unlike anything the region has seen since the OPEC price increases in the 1970s (see Exhibit 2). Even though gas prices have moderated of late, they are still 10 times higher than the average in 2019.  Inflation is in double digits in some countries, consumer sentiment has collapsed, and demand is weakening along with disposable income. Nonetheless, we believe headline inflation has peaked and will return to the ECB’s 2% target in 2024.  
 The response of governments to economic shocks has changed since the pandemic. Instead of counting on automatic stabilisers such as unemployment insurance to tide households through the downturn, governments have resorted to more direct support to mitigate any decline in income (or corporate profits).  
 This strategy was comparatively easy during the pandemic as policy rates and inflation were low and central banks were purchasing government debt. The recent experience of the UK, however, shows the limits of these policies now that inflation is well above target and central banks are looking to reduce the size of their balance sheets. While Germany can afford a EUR 200 billion support package, other countries may not. When Italian government bond yields were above 4% prior to the global financial crisis, the country’s debt was a few percentage points less than its GDP. It is now 40% greater. In 2022, debt-GDP ratios nonetheless improved, but in 2023, they will likely see a deterioration. Governments will need to ensure further expenditure is targeted to avoid a countervailing response to any stimulus from the ECB.  
 The EUR 2 trillion NextGenerationEU recovery plan (the largest EU stimulus package ever) will be key to creating a “greener, more digital and more resilient Europe”.

 China  The two factors that were dragging on Chinese growth in 2022 — its zero-Covid policies and an unsteady property market — should moderate in 2023, allowing the economy to rebound, though growth will likely remain below pre-pandemic levels.  
 Covid infections in China have spiked again. Nevertheless, the government has reiterated its commitment to ZCP. At the same time, work on an mRNA vaccine is progressing and it should eventually be rolled out. We now know from experience that economic activity can rebound quickly once restrictions are lifted.  
 The problems in the property market will likely take longer to address. The recent Communist Party Congress signalled there would be longer-term policies to develop a housing system that ensures supply from multiple sources and the development of both rental and property sales markets. In the near term, the government is looking to targeted policies to support the recovery of the sector.  
 President Xi’s Party Congress speech was also notable for its emphasis on speeding up the transition to green development and meeting carbon emissions goals. This should be another source of long-term demand for companies in the relevant industries. 
 A key distinction between China and the US and Europe is the scope the government has to stimulate the economy, through either fiscal or monetary measures. While core inflation is at over 4% in the eurozone and over 6% in the US, in China, it is at just 0.4% (see Exhibit 3). 2

 2022 has been an extraordinary year, marking the end of an extraordinary decade and a half since the Global Financial Crisis (GFC). A sharp and swift rise in real discount rates caused bruising losses across asset classes, ending the panacea that ‘lower for longer’ interest rates delivered for risky assets over many decades. For example, an investor in a portfolio of 60% global equities and 40% government bonds had lost an eye-watering 20% by late October. That is a far cry from the 9-10% she or he would have grown accustomed to making over the last 50-odd years. These losses were the steepest incurred in a generation – including 2008, which saw losses of ‘just’ 14%.  
 We, as others, had seen this steep rise in real yields as the chief risk facing financial markets in 2022. Our multi-asset portfolios were short duration, neutral equities (through a combination of long Asia and short Europe), and long commodities for much of 2022. Yet, as sovereign bond yields, particularly real yields, quickly approached post-GFC highs, we took profits on our long-standing short in government bonds.  
 One of the biggest questions for 2023 is how soon central banks will pause, or even reverse, their discount rate increases and what impact this will have on the value of cash flows across asset classes. Certainly in 2022, the bulk of asset market moves can be explained by changes in the discount rate.  
 We are now turning more constructive on corporate credit, particularly higher- grade credit in Europe. Here, we believe low valuations (that is, high spreads), do

 not accurately reflect what we believe are favourable fundamentals. We are not yet ready to add more broadly to riskier assets such as equities. We are still concerned over greater downside to both growth and earnings, and continued  
 geopolitical uncertainty could weigh further on cash flow projections. At the same time, we acknowledge that areas including long-duration US tech companies are starting to look interesting as 2022 draws to a close.  
 Every risk has its price 
 There are usually a handful of key judgements upon which one’s investment views ultimately rest. Today, there are three particular questions that matter enormously for return prospects in 2023.  
 1. When will the US Federal Reserve and other major central banks pivot towards lowering policy rates? 2. How deep will the growth and earnings correction be? 3. (The biggest unknown) How great will geopolitical disruption from China, Russia- Ukraine, the US, and Europe (including the UK) be in 2023?

 The Fed has so far delivered the sharpest speed of policy tightening ever delivered. When will they pause and to allow effects of the increases to work their way through the system, avoiding the policy error of pushing on the brakes too hard? On balance, our judgment is that the odds of a quicker, sharper policy pivot are mounting, and prospectively quite fast.

 Interest rates, both real and nominal, both current and implied, increased dramatically in major economies in 2022. While the increase occurred across the curve, it was particularly sharp at the short end. The 500bp rise in 2-year real rates since March was has been remarkable, as was the move in the expected level of fed funds in three years from 1.5% to 5% in just six months. Five-year real rates (measured five years ahead), that many view as a long-term guide for ‘neutral’ policy rates, have soared from 50-year to levels last seen prior to the GFC. They stood at just -85bp in the US and -1.4% in Europe a year ago, whereas at the time of writing they were 1.50% and 1.25%, respectively. There are good reasons for those levels, including a significant shift in the fiscal-monetary mix, a turn in structural trends such as globalisation that had preserved the downtrend in government bonds, and favourable demographics. But there are good reasons, too, for them to pause for breath, with mounting headwinds for both inflation and growth.  
 Persistently high inflation has tested central bank credibility 
 Persistently high inflation has tested central bank credibility, forcing them to set interest rates in the ‘rear view mirror’. But effective policy rates are now priced to reach a fairly restrictive 5.0-5.5% in the US 1  and 2.25% in Europe by mid-2023, just as growth and inflation weaken from the tightening already feeding through the system. We believe a pause in the rate hikes (which have been the dominant driver of weakness in asset prices in 2022), could offer some respite for risk assets. The question is how much.

 Staying long high-quality European corporate credit at fairly distressed valuations is one area that continues to look compelling to us. At the time of writing, spreads are at 2020 crisis levels for the best-rated European corporates, with an implied default rate of around 10%. That is more than twice the worst five-year rate and eight times the average. Furthermore, and unusually at this point in the cycle, leverage ratios at these companies are contained and falling, interest coverage is high and corporate balance sheets are firm. The pressure then on companies to de-lever, which is what tends to dent credit as economic cycles weaken, is conspicuously absent this time as companies enter a potential recession long cash and with longer duration debt.  
 Our judgement here is cautious on what it means  for earnings, or equity cash flows 
 This leads neatly to the second question raised above: the depth of the coming growth correction, and the state of household balance sheets, as 2022 draws to a close with double-digit inflation. This environment makes us more cautious, particularly as far as earnings are concerned. Consequently, we are leaning away from investing in assets lower down the capital structure, especially equities, in more challenged areas such as Europe.  
 Our economics team expects the US to lose three million jobs early in 2023, with payrolls falling by 300 000 or more. The housing market is expected to continue weakening. We see mortgage rates nearly 400bp higher than in the summer of 2021 and mortgage applications falling steeply. Europe’s economic outlook is similarly poor, with greater downside risks from the war in Ukraine and the energy crisis, and households with a smaller savings buffer. We know from the GFC the impact of a

 wilting housing market on growth, and we are now having the additional impact of sticky and rising housing rents on services inflation. This increasingly fragile  
 macroeconomic environment seems profoundly disconnected with relatively optimistic corporate earnings expectations. As a result we are neutral on equities, but with a deeply cautious view on Europe balanced by more optimism towards China and Japan. While equites delivered double-digit total return losses in 2022, and valuations cheapened from January 2022’s lofty highs, losses would have been steeper were it not for expectations of positive earnings growth for 2022 and 2023.  
 This increasingly fragile macroeconomic  environment seems profoundly disconnected 
 Earnings expectations are at best a coincident indicator, but they are too high for the macroeconomic setting just described. We have several frameworks for thinking about where earnings and valuations should be at different points in the cycle. With the exception of Asia and, more recently the US Nasdaq index, our research points to further falls to come — from both lower valuations and earnings — before we reach fair value.  
 Lastly, geopolitical risks pepper the investment horizon. This is something we will monitor closely in 2023. The evolution of the Ukraine war and the energy crisis; China’s approach to Taiwan and the reopening of its economy; trade wars and their impact on supply chains – each of these developments could alter the path of both cash flows and discount rates. With no quick resolution in sight, risks here are likely to remain elevated.

 Focus on fixed income - A new bond world 
 Fixed income bonds saw unprecedentedly poor returns in 2022, with all key sectors  
 posting a negative performance (as at 10 November 2022) due to a normalisation of policy rates, recession hurting credit spreads, and liquidity shocks driving up volatility. After a more than 50-year bull market, a new bond world has emerged in which it is now possible to earn a positive absolute performance.  
 Central banks have managed to drive interest rates to normalised levels, meaning rates should not need to rise meaningfully from here. Five year-five year real yields in the US and the eurozone have returned to their post-Global Financial Crisis highs. Consequently, carry will be essential in generating returns in the future. Investors should recall that historically, carry accounts for the bulk of fixed i ncome total returns. The transition to the new world is not complete, however, meaning volatility will likely remain high and asset allocation is crucial. 2023 will see both growth and inflation decelerate and accelerate, calling for different allocations depending on the macroeconomic regime.  
 Any return to fixed income should focus on core assets such as money market instruments, government bonds and investment-grade credit, alongside diversifying satellite investments in flexible bonds, green bonds and emerging market debt.  
 Investing back in money markets is attractive as they offer visibility thanks to short duration, and now attractive yields given the substantial rise in short-term rates. We could see declines in US policy rates by the end of 2023, though this is less likely in the eurozone.  
 We believe eurozone investment-grade credit is attractive as spreads at the time of writing are commensurate with much higher default rates than we think will actually materialise.

 SUSTAINABILITY 
 JANE AMBACHTSHEER  
 Global head of sustainability 
 ALEXANDER BERNHARDT 
 Global head of sustainability research 
 In early 2005, United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan invited a group of the world’s largest institutional investors to help develop the Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI). Only a few years later, the excesses of a lightly regulated financial system would spark a global economic crisis while undermining many of the financial models used till then. In retrospect, this was an appropriate time for finance to begin to wake up to some of the excesses of corporate behaviour it was enabling. Since then, we have seen a  ten-fold  increase in sustainable investment related regulations. Here, we explore this evolution and the path that lies ahead.  
 The great financial crisis raised important questions about the role of finance. The industry has long interpreted its fiduciary duty to clients as a requirement to ‘maximise’ financial returns for ‘beneficiaries’, most often on a horizon of quarters or years.  
 Since 2005, the industry has rigorously debated the impact of integrating environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria into this duty. The discussion has been buffeted by parallel debates over the timeframe across which return maximisation should be sought and for which beneficiaries.  
 In 2005, the research basis for understanding the financial impact of ESG considerations was relatively thin. Since then, our understanding of this topic has grown massively.

 There is much to do to realise ESG integration with proper strength and accuracy across portfolios 
 ESG factors and investment outcomes  What we can now say with some certainty is that ESG integration – at corporate and fund levels – more often than not leads to better financial outcomes. Thanks largely to the efforts of the PRI and other industry groups, the fiduciary duty debate has largely been put to bed. Investors controlling more than USD 100 trillion in assets have agreed at the highest levels to this preface to the PRI’s six principles:  
 “As institutional investors, we have a duty to act in the best long-term interests of our beneficiaries. In this fiduciary role, we believe that environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) issues can affect the performance of investment portfolios (to varying degrees across companies, sectors, regions, asset classes and through time). We also recognise that applying these Principles may better align investors with broader objectives of society.” 
 While the investment industry agrees in principle, much remains to be done to realise ESG integration with proper strength and accuracy across portfolios. The gap between ambition and actuality underlies much of the recent criticism of ESG (namely greenwashing) revolving around misleading claims by some investors and the messiness of ESG data. Regulators have stepped up their efforts to create clarity on the definition and application of ‘sustainability’. Sustainable investment regulations have grown globally from below 50 in 2015 to more than 500. 1   
 Tackling ESG criticism  Here, we explore some of the criticisms. Often, they go too far and warrant a closer look on the basis of the following:  
 • ESG has been an attention grabber, not a distraction. ESG integration efforts have highlighted issues such as climate risk and diversity. This has likely accelerated corporate and policy action rather than distracted from them. • What’s your counterfactual? Admittedly, many environmental and social indicators have worsened over the past 20 years. But would the environment and society be better off if the investment industry had ignored ESG as was largely the case before 2004? That is unlikely. • ESG is just data. At the most basic level, ESG indicators convey dispassionate information about company management that can materially impact results. True, the data is often sparsely disclosed, rarely audited and diversely interpreted. For thoughtful investors, properly analysed data can convey important and tradable information which can lead to outperformance.

 • Fees aren’t the issue. Some critics say the industry uses ESG as an excuse to charge more. While this may be the case for some passive funds and their ESG equivalents, the data does not support this claim for the bulk of actively managed ESG funds. For the most part, ESG funds are priced similarly to equivalent standard funds. • ESG is more than just emissions. While climate change can be seen as the most important global systemic risk, it is not the only one. For instance, if we succeed in cutting emissions, but exacerbate inequality, we will be trading one systemic risk for another. 
 The ability to generate sustainable returns relies on a healthy planet and population 
 Necessary step to sustainable finance  Before ESG, there was Socially Responsible Investing. SRI was dedicated to the creation of a just and sustainable economic system. With the advent of the PRI, the focus shifted to ESG factors. This stripped away notions of responsibility and irresponsibility to focus on the bottom line and the financial risks and rewards of accounting for these factors.  
 The success of the ESG movement has set the table for broader discussions on the future of sustainable finance. We are coming full circle, moving away from a pure financial focus on integrating ESG factors towards recognising that investors have real impact on the world – and that their ability to generate sustainable returns relies on a healthy planet and population. More than 270 asset managers with some USD 61 trillion in assets under management have now committed to net zero portfolio emissions by 2050 by signing the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative. 2   
 Without the efforts of the PRI and other industry groups, we would not now see ESG issues on the agendas in most boardrooms and policy action being taken to address ESG transparency and encourage investment in sustainability solutions.  
 We also see that the world has not made the required progress towards a low- carbon, environmentally sustainable and inclusive economy that we collectively require to ensure long-term returns. This means there is more to do. The astounding growth of the ‘ESG industry’ has forced a long overdue discussion on the intersection between societal well-being and investment. What was old is new again, and hopefully, just in time.

 ENVIRONMENTAL THEMATICS 
 History can help assess the future

 Understanding the drivers of past industrial revolutions can be invaluable when assessing long-term investment opportunities such as those presented by the effects of climate change and the current energy crisis. What the lessons can investors draw from economic history? 
 Even amid the headwinds from crises such as the food and energy supply stress and extreme climate phenomena, the world is on the cusp of a new industrial revolution – one that could allow capacity – and resources – to be used more efficiently and lead to a greener and more sustainable future. 
 ‘Industry 4.0’ – involving such advances as the smart factory, autonomous systems, 3D printing and machine learning – promises to provide us with the tools for a replenished biosphere, greater energy and food security, and improved living standards and job opportunities.  
 It also looks set to usher in a sharing economy involving ‘open source’ approaches to information and innovation which can accelerate change including the energy transition. A practical example: in such a setting, people will more rarely own cars; they will simply hire a (probably autonomous electric) vehicle when they need to.

 The road to industry 4.0  Such progress needs massive investment. However, assessing which will be the long-term winners and avoiding the short-term ‘fads’ can be a challenge. A look at previous revolutions can help.  
 The original industrial revolution, in England between 1760 and 1860, was driven by technological progress, education, and a growing capital stock. It turned the country into ‘the workshop of the world’ and brought about a sustained rise in real income per head.  
 The second industrial revolution, in the US from the 1850s, was driven by factors such as electrification, crude oil production, the rapid spread of telephony, and assembly-line vehicle production. These helped ignite the country’s ascent to a global superpower.  
 By the early 2000s, the productivity potential of the infrastructure upon which the second industrial revolution was built had become exhausted. A new technological infrastructure emerged, driven by computers, IT networks and robotics. These sowed the seeds of Industry 4.0.  
 This latest revolution could be transformative, for economies, the environment, and the way societies are organised

 of producing and delivering more and more goods and services to near zero (or a marginal amount).  
 Over the next decade, Industry 4.0 infrastructure looks set to expand to include, for example, self-driving cars using cheap renewable energy on smart transport ‘internets’. This should allow people to share mobility, but also communication and energy.  
 Identifying themes and winners  How can we identify those companies that can survive and prosper for the next 10 to 20 years? 
 In our view, history has shown that the rate of technological change and cost declines have often surpassed projections. Just look at the share of electricity from renewable sources in total US power generation. Environmental solutions such as green hydrogen, solar energy or bio-plastics are disrupting manufacturing and supply chains and transforming global consumer behaviour.  
 Understanding this accelerating consumption transformation helps to inform  our investment decisions 
 Understanding this accelerating transformation – and, importantly, its impact on the industries affected by it – helps to inform our investment decisions. We seek to benefit from the penetration of transformative technologies, the growth rates that this advance brings for industries and companies, and what this means for their lifecycles.  
 Finding winners takes research, an open mind, and the ability to examine challenges and opportunities from multiple perspectives. It also means having the conviction to strictly target positive environmental outcomes.  
 What is required is a wider understanding of the breadth – and, crucially, the inter- relatedness – of the challenges that, for example, the energy crisis presents and the opportunities it creates, such as an accelerated transition to renewable, locally produced sources of energy.  
 A thorough understanding of previous and current periods of disruption can help us identify the potential investment winners of the coming new carbon-free age. And we are convinced that active investment management is the key to identifying companies that can outperform.

 DISRUPTIVE TECH 
 Secular growth drivers dominate 
 PAM HEGARTY 
 Portfolio manager 
 VINCENT NICHOLS 
 Investment specialist 
 The outlook for the technology sector in 2023 is difficult to assess, given the significant macroeconomic and geopolitical headwinds. However, we remain confident in the durability of the secular growth drivers that underpin our strategy – cloud computing, artificial intelligence, automation, and the Internet of Things – as well as the foundational technologies that enable these themes. We believe that the leaders and beneficiaries of digital transformation will deliver superior revenue growth, earnings, cash flows, and returns over a long-term investment horizon. 
 During most of 2022, the tech sector underperformed the broader market as interest rates rose. As a result, valuations have compressed, with little to no ‘froth’ left today, especially in the semiconductor and software industries.  
 While negative earnings revisions are likely as the economy slows, we see potential for the sector to outperform on a relative basis, given the historical resilience of tech profits during recessions. As growth becomes scarcer, investors may once again be willing to pay up for quality growth.  
 Opportunities as we head into 2023  1. The adoption of cloud computing, artificial intelligence (AI), automation, and the Internet of Things continue as companies strive to save costs and make better decisions. 2.

 corporate spending on information technology (IT). Gartner forecasts 5% growth in IT spending in 2023. Cybersecurity is one area that we expect to hold up well. 3. Semiconductor demand may prove resilient in end-markets including automotive (where electronic content is increasing and inventories remain low) and datacentre (depending on the resiliency of spending to support cloud and AI initiatives). 4. Valuations look compelling. We estimate the average enterprise value to next- twelve-month estimated sales ratio for North American software stocks to be nearly back to 6x. That is close to the 2013-2018 level and 32% below the most recent five-year average (see Exhibit 1). 5. Most semiconductor stocks are trading near (or below) our worst-case scenarios, as investors have priced in inventory corrections across all end-markets. 6. Longer duration real yields have arguably peaked. So even as the US Federal Reserve continues to raise rates, valuations should not necessarily decline further. Additionally, growth will again become scarce, likely leading investors to gravitate back towards quality growth. 
 IT spending and semiconductor demand should prove resilient, while valuations look compelling 
 What are the risks?:  1. Real interest rates could rise further, which would have a negative impact on the valuation of long duration assets. 2. Weakness in consumer spending on personal computers and low-end smartphones could spread to commercial and enterprise customers and other end-markets.

 3. COVID beneficiaries such as the e-commerce sector might continue to underperform as growth reverts to pre-pandemic trend lines. 4. The Ukraine war, the Sino-US trade war, and authoritarian and nationalist movements, including supply chain nationalism, are creating uncertainty. 5. Regulation remains a risk.  
 Secular growth drivers should dominate short-term concerns over a three-plus year horizon 
 In summary  We believe bottom-up fundamental stock research, combined with portfolio construction discipline, is the best approach for navigating the uncertainty. We are revisiting each company-level financial model to stress-test it for recession scenarios and ensure our target prices are conservative.  
 We have analysed our holdings based on their revenue growth potential and stability over the next three years, and the strength of their ‘moat’, or their competitive positioning and balance sheet strength. We are invested in high-quality, stable-growth names with deep ‘moats’. As for the more speculative growth stocks with longer duration cash flows, our positions are modest.  
 We are looking for stocks that have de-risked or have idiosyncratic drivers that will prove to be resilient in a recession. Examples include Micron Technology 1 , where earnings revisions have fallen sharply and the stock is now trading at barely above book value, and First Solar 1 , which has fully contracted all of its production for the next two years, while US tax credits should allow it to expand production capacity.  
 We are confident that secular growth drivers will dominate short-term cyclical concerns over a three-plus year investment horizon. We focus on owning sustainable leaders or beneficiaries of the digital transformation, with enduring competitive advantages, trading at compelling valuations.

 CHINA 
 Deglobalisation in the context of ‘China decoupling’ 
 CHI LO 
 Senior market strategist APAC 
 ‘Decouple-from-China’ has been a market issue since the Sino-US trade war started in 2018, with some large developed countries pushing for reshoring their global production. This has led to concern about deglobalisation, or the breaking- up of supply chains and decelerating cross-border trade and investment. These developments have shaken the argument for investing in Asia, including China, which lies at the heart of many global supply chains.  
 Restrictions on technology transfers, among other trade-disrupting measures, are currently the biggest uncertainty for Asia; a third of its exports involve electronic and other tech products.  
 The Covid-19 crisis aggravated the concern over the outlook for manufacturing in Asia – disrupting global supply chains and creating shortages of everything from building materials and car parts to semiconductors.  
 Asia’s supply chains shifting  Though these worries have driven some large companies to cut their sourcing from or manufacturing operations in Asia and to shift them elsewhere, we see no large- scale decoupling from either the region or from China.  
 Firstly, defying expectations that the trade war and the pandemic would crimp Sino- US bilateral trade, trade actually rose from an annualised USD 620 billion in June 2018 to USD 801 billion in August 2022. This was partly because US shipments to

 China picked up, even though Chinese purchases fell short of the so-called Phase One deal signed in January 2020.  
 Secondly, rather than reducing their reliance on Asian supply chains, US importers have increased imports from the wider ASEAN region. 1 
 Flows of foreign direct investment (FDI) to China have risen over the last six years (see Exhibit 1). 
 Buying more from ASEAN does not mean  buying less or decoupling from China 
 No decoupling  Buying more from ASEAN does not mean buying less or decoupling from China. Rather, this shift in the pattern of imports illustrates a so-called ‘China + 1’ strategy, in which companies keep producing in China for the local market while moving some capacity to ASEAN.  
 Relocation is a means to manage the supply chain disruption due to economic, political and, most recently, Covid-19 considerations. This is reflected in the rising flow of FDI to ASEAN (see Exhibit 2). The persistence of investment in China underscores our long-held ‘Invest in China for China’ view since the US shifted its China policy from constructive engagement to strategic competition in 2016.  
 1. The ASEAN member states include Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.

 Crucially, a large share of the FDI flows to ASEAN comes from China, which accounts for 40% of the total now as compared to only 10% a few years ago. This actually strengthens the supply-chain integration between ASEAN and China rather than weakening it. Components used to be shipped from ASEAN to China, which then sold them to the world markets. That made China the world’s factory. Now the process appears to be reversing: China supplies ASEAN with products that power the region’s exports to the world. This shift in the supply-chain integration process has expanded the world’s factory to now include Asia.  
 The persistence of investment in China underscores our long-held ‘Invest in China for China’ view 
 Implications  Asia’s supply chain shift also reflects China’s ‘dual circulation’ policy. Beijing aims to use its internal growth impetus to drive domestic and regional growth. This potential is a strong basis for long-term investment in emerging Asia and China.  
 From a macroeconomic perspective, this development will likely lead to strong intra-regional economic linkages confounding the deglobalisation trend. With inflation concerns rising and companies facing higher input price pressures, the cost advantages of sourcing from Asia, whose supply chains have integrated further with China, are becoming more obvious.  
 Subtle shifts are underway to make Asia an emerging production hub for world markets. We see little evidence yet of global and regional decoupling from China. One can run, but not hide, from the Middle Kingdom.

 Head of infrastructure debt 
 Resilience in private markets - infrastructure debt 
 Almost USD 10 trillion has now been invested in these markets, in what has become a global and ever more diverse asset class spanning corporate loans, real assets, structured finance and other instruments. In this article, we focus on infrastructure debt. 
 Amid the search for yield and the need for portfolio quality, the private debt segment is becoming increasingly relevant. Having grown by 13-14% a year over the past decade, total private debt assets under management (AUM) now exceed well over USD 1 trillion.  
 As an asset class, private debt has been resilient across economic cycles. As an example, it was the only private markets asset class to have increased fundraising every year since 2011, including during the pandemic.  
 For investors willing to invest their money for longer periods, private debt can be a good portfolio diversifier, offering low volatility and a low correlation to listed markets. Other attractions include an appealing relative value, inflation-linked cash flows and an illiquidity premium over listed assets.  
 Floating rate instruments are part of the segment. They can be more attractive than vanilla bonds as their coupon is linked to a base rate, allowing it to increase amid rising market interest rates.

 Recession-proof essential services  Historically, infrastructure debt has shown itself to be a haven. This segment offers a diverse range of exposures across many defensive sectors (see Exhibit 1) and risk- return profiles.  
 Overall, we believe the segment is well positioned for recession, for the same reasons that it navigated the pandemic better than other asset classes: many infrastructure projects involve essential services that are in demand in times of boom and times of bust. In other words, when times are tough, people will still need rail networks, energy to heat and light their homes, etc.  
 Infrastructure debt is well positioned for recession 
 As investments, infrastructure assets – from fibre optic networks and car parks to utilities and roads – are marked by high barriers to entry: projects cost large sums to complete, keeping competitors at bay. Often, they involve monopolistic market positions and regulated tariffs. Their long-dated cash flows across economic cycles offer stability to investors.  
 Green infrastructure  Infrastructure debt also has environmental, social, and governance (ESG) aspects. Many infrastructure assets are at the forefront of the energy transition and digitalisation, partly on the back of the European Union's objectives for decarbonisation and net zero by 2050.

 These goals are driving investment decisions: Along with the large sums for phasing out conventional energy in the utilities sector, more renewable energy infrastructure will need to be built over the next few decades, for example, for electrified fleets and the greater use of (green) hydrogen. As for the role of digitalisation in decarbonisation, data analytics can help improve (energy) efficiency.  
 In selecting investments, our proprietary ESG framework has been fully integrated in the investment process. It includes a comprehensive assessment by our Sustainability Centre, while an independent consultant assesses the impact of each investment based on induced and avoided emissions, the net environmental contribution and ‘temperature alignment’ with the Paris Accord.  
 Junior infrastructure debt, which delivers higher, equity-like returns, could be an attractive option  
 Junior debt to weather the storm  Over the past 10 years, infrastructure debt has offered consistently higher yields than listed bonds, partly due to the additional return investors receive for forgoing the flexibility of publicly traded markets. While infrastructure debt returns have remained fairly consistent, central bank rate rises have boosted yields on government and corporate bonds, sapping the yield premium.  
 For investors seeking a yield similar to equivalently rated corporate bonds, this has made the choice between these two asset classes less straightforward. However, we believe junior infrastructure debt, which delivers higher, equity-like returns while maintaining debt-like protections such as covenants, and contained risk, could be an attractive option.

 The value of investments and the income they generate may go down as well as up and it is possible that investors will not recover their initial outlay. Investing in emerging markets, or specialised or restricted sectors is likely to be subject to a higher than average volatility due to a high degree of concentration, greater uncertainty because less information is available, there is less liquidity, or due to greater sensitivity to changes in market conditions (social, political and economic conditions). Some emerging markets offer less security than the majority of international developed markets. For this reason, services for portfolio transactions, liquidation and conservation on behalf of funds invested in emerging markets may carry greater risk.

Prior to any subscription in a country in which such financial instrument(s) is/are registered, investors should verify any legal constraints or restrictions there may be in connection with the subscription, purchase, possession or sale of the financial instrument(s).

 Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) Investment Risk: The lack of common or harmonized definitions and labels integrating ESG and sustainability criteria at EU level may result in different approaches by managers when setting ESG objectives. This also means that it may be difficult to compare strategies integrating ESG and sustainability criteria to the extent that the selection and weightings applied to select investments may be based on metrics that may share the same name but have different underlying meanings. In evaluating a security based on the ESG and sustainability criteria, the Investment Manager may also use data sources provided by external ESG research providers. Given the evolving nature of ESG, these data sources may for the time being be incomplete, inaccurate or unavailable. Applying responsible business conduct standards in the investment process may lead to the exclusion of securities of certain issuers. Consequently, the Sub-Fund's performance may at times be better or worse than the performance of relatable funds that do not apply such standards.

 2023 OUTLOOK 
 Dear Clients,  
 To say 2022 was a tumultuous year is an understatement.  Equity markets, which had peaked in January, dropped precipitously in less than two months as investors reacted to higher inflation and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Inflation in turn triggered the tightening of monetary policy. Central bank policy rates and interest rates across maturities rose at the fastest pace in decades, driving bond prices down by unprecedented amounts. Oil and natural gas prices gyrated as the Nord Stream 2 project was halted and other energy export sanctions were imposed on Russia. Financial markets were further roiled by growing global geopolitical tensions following the invasion of Ukraine but also aggressive posturing by China, including toward Taiwan.  This year is likely to be less tumultuous for markets. Inflation is already trending lower. Central banks are expected to continue to tighten, but not to the extent seen in 2022. As a result, bonds will come under less pressure. Oil and natural gas prices are less likely to gyrate.  Still, we face great uncertainty. The US Federal Reserve may overtighten monetary policy and create a recession in the United States. A recession in the world’s largest economy would reverberate globally. The US Congress may repeat the mistakes of 2011 in failing to raise the debt limit in a timely and orderly manner. China’s disorderly abandonment of its “zero-COVID” policy may unleash another wave of COVID-19 infections, including new variants, globally. The geopolitical outlook for 2023, too, is foggy and fraught with risk. There is no face-saving off-ramp for Russia from Ukraine. China is unlikely to reverse its assertive and aggressive posture. North Korea is expected to continue, even step up, its ballistic missile tests. Iran may proceed to enrich its uranium to weapons- grade levels, which could elicit a military response by Israel.  We proceed with caution. 
  We start with a careful review of the turmoil in financial markets last year because this backdrop is important in understanding the fog of uncertainty still facing investors.

  Among financial assets, none were spared in 2022. US equities, as measured by the S&P 500, had a maximum drawdown of 25% and ended the year with a total return of -18% (in line with the bad case scenario, to which we had assigned a 15% probability in last year’s  Outlook ). The basket of FANGMANT stocks (Facebook/Meta, Apple, Netflix, Google/Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, Nvidia and Tesla), with a maximum aggregate drawdown of 44%, were among the worst-performing stocks in the S&P 500. Facebook/Meta and Tesla did particularly poorly, experiencing maximum drawdowns of over 70%.  Outside the US, Russian equities had the largest drop, at 51%; China came next, at 45%; they were followed by Italy at 28% and Germany at 26%—all in local currency terms.  Also in 2022, bonds, which typically hedge portfolios against equity drawdowns by rising in value, nose-dived in response to a steady stream of rising inflation and interest rate hikes in the advanced economies. The maximum drawdown in the price of 10-year US Treasuries was 22%. It seldom happens that 10-year Treasuries—which have half the volatility of US equities—drop nearly as much as these equities.  The maximum drawdown of 10-year German bunds was 21%, and that of 10-year UK gilts, 26%. This drop in the price of 10-year UK gilts stood in sharp contrast to the 5% total return of UK equities, as measured by the FTSE 100. The latter’s positive return was driven primarily by the energy sector and the metals and mining sector.  Shorter-term bond benchmarks declined less but declined nonetheless: the maximum drop was 11% for 1- to 10- year US Treasuries, 12% for 1- to 10-year German bunds and 15% for UK gilts.  Oil and natural gas were thrown into turmoil with the invasion of Ukraine, and energy security has been thrust back into the forefront after a long hiatus. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil prices rose 62% between January and June 2022, only to fall 42% to their subsequent trough in early December; for the year, WTI rose 7%.

 descending as storage facilities filled up given a milder start to the winter season. For the year, prices were up 8%. Prices in Europe are still over five times as high as those in the US, where natural gas prices were also volatile last year but much less so than in Europe. US natural gas prices increased by a cumulative 160% to peak in August before dropping, and now stand 20% above their levels at the start of 2022.  Global economic growth surprised to the downside; our forecast of 4.5% growth for 2022 made at the beginning of the year is now 3.0%, or 30% lower. US economic growth, forecast last year to be 3.9%, is now estimated to be 50% lower, at 2.0%.  The US Consumer Price Index (CPI) reached a peak of 9.1% in June 2022. Core CPI, which excludes food and energy prices, peaked at 6.6% in September 2022. The US Federal Reserve’s preferred measure, the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index, peaked at 7.0%, also in June, and the core PCE price index peaked at 5.4% in February. Eurozone and UK inflation rates likely peaked in October at 10.6% and 11.1%, respectively. We expect US inflation to decline to 3.7%, as measured by headline CPI, by the end of 2023.  In 2022, central banks raised rates at one of the fastest paces on record to combat inflation. As shown in Exhibit 1, such a pace has not been seen in the US since the early 1980s, when the country faced inflation that peaked at nearly 14.8% in March 1980. The pace has also never been seen in the history of the European Central Bank since its inception in 1998. Such a large and rapid increase in policy rates contributed to the turmoil in financial markets; we do not expect a repeat in 2023.

Still others recommended adding trading strategies, including hedge funds and momentum- and volatility-based strategies.  The proliferation of such recommendations prompted some of our clients to ask whether they should reevaluate their strategic asset allocation accordingly. Our response is twofold.  First, appropriate, customized diversification for both institutional and private wealth clients has been a key pillar of the Investment Strategy Group’s (ISG’s) investment philosophy since its inception more than 20 years ago in 2001 (see Exhibit 2). Such diversification around a core holding of equities and bonds already includes asset classes and investment strategies that enhance risk/return to preserve and then maximize risk-adjusted wealth, especially at times of heightened uncertainty.  Second, nearly a hundred years of data demonstrates that a mixture of stocks and bonds is an effective starting point for a portfolio, consistent with another pillar of ISG’s investment philosophy that history is a useful guide. The 60/40 portfolio has generated positive returns on a rolling 12-month basis 80% of the time since 1926.  
 Geopolitical Tumult 
 On the geopolitical front, the warning of the late Ash Carter, former US secretary of defense, was realized. We regularly consulted with him on geopolitical issues, and as was outlined in our 2022  Outlook: Piloting Through , he had asserted that the Russian threat to Ukraine was “the most dangerous, dire, and imminent of all the geopolitical risks.” 1  So far, the Russia-Ukraine war has led to:  
 • About 100,000 casualties on each side, according to General Mark Milley, chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff 2  • The exodus of 7.8 million Ukrainian refugees to other countries, particularly in Europe, and another 6.5 million displaced from their homes within Ukraine 3

 • Over $100 billion in global military, financial and humanitarian aid to Ukraine (about half from the US), with at least another $45 billion expected in 2023 4 
 • A World Bank estimate of $525 billion−$630 billion of reconstruction in Ukraine as of December 5   
 The war has also led to further deterioration in US-China relations, especially when coupled with the joint China-Russia statement on February 4, 2022, that the “friendship between the two States has no limits.” 6  The US and its allies have been changing their national security strategies toward China and imposing import and export controls on a wide variety of products.  Turmoil in financial markets coupled with heightened geopolitical risks has raised the risks, though not the certainty, of a recession. Historically, rapid and extensive tightening by the Federal Reserve has led to recession in the US. Many economists expect it. Bill Dudley, who served as president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, vice chair of the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee (FOMC) and Goldman Sachs partner, assigns a 70% probability to a US recession in 2023—one of the highest probability forecasts in the industry.  At the other extreme, Jan Hatzius, currently Goldman Sachs’ chief economist and head of Global Investment Research, assigns a 35% probability to a US recession—one of the lowest in the industry. Incidentally, Dudley and Hatzius developed the Goldman Sachs Financial Conditions Index while they worked together at Goldman Sachs. The index measures the impact of Federal Reserve policy on the economy through the impact on the financial markets, specifically on short- and intermediate-maturity interest rates, equity markets, incremental yield of corporate bonds and the value of the trade-weighted dollar relative to other currencies. The wide difference between the forecasts of these two former colleagues is mirrored across the economic forecasting community.  Notably, in his latest press conference, on December 14, 2022, Jerome H. Powell, chair of the Federal Reserve, said “I don’t think anyone knows whether we’re going to have a recession or not … It’s just not knowable.” 7

  Similarly, a week later, Lawrence H. Summers, Harvard University professor and former US Treasury secretary, wrote that “there is no basis for confident economic prediction. Some of the most stridently made arguments are also the silliest.” 8   When Chair Powell says that “it’s just not knowable,” we take heed; we assign a range of 45−55% to the probability of a US recession in 2023. To provide context: over the last decade, the highest probability we assigned to a recession was 30%. That was in our 2012  Outlook , after the European sovereign debt crisis; the next-highest probability was 20−25%, in our 2020  Outlook .  Today, many leading indicators are pointing in opposite directions, and we believe it is important to convey this uncertainty to our clients unequivocally. In this uncertain environment, we believe portfolios should not be positioned for the certainty of recession nor for the certainty of modest economic growth. Instead, we recommend portfolios be positioned at their customized strategic asset allocation, where they are designed to ride out volatility and provide staying power in the event of geopolitical disruptions.  If a recession is averted, financial market returns in 2023 will be less volatile than in 2022; we expect a moderate-risk diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds to provide a total return of 9.0% for taxable clients and 9.8% for tax-exempt clients.  If a recession occurs early in the year, corporate earnings and equities will decline—possibly beyond the maximum drawdown of 2022—but bonds will hedge the portfolio by increasing in value, because the starting point of interest rates is much higher than it was at the beginning of 2022. However, by the end of 2023, as the recession recedes and the fog of uncertainty lifts, the equity market will most likely rally. We would expect high-single-digit returns for a moderate-risk diversified portfolio. If the recession lasts beyond year-end, the equity market will most likely end the year near the lows we saw in 2022, providing a total return of negative 4.4% from year-end 2022 and resulting in a low- to mid-single-digit negative return for a moderate-risk portfolio.  Facing the fog of uncertainty in financial markets, economic growth and geopolitics, we will on our side:

 • Watch diligently for hazards and, if appropriate, pull into a safe location and wait for the fog to clear. • Use our fog lights to search for tactical strategies that can take advantage of market volatility as opportunities present themselves.  
 On our clients’ side, we recommend that you:  
 • Avoid unnecessary lane changes; stay invested at your customized strategic asset allocation. • Allow extra time to reach your destination, as US equity markets will resume their historical upward trajectory. 
 In Section I, we provide the rationale for assigning a 45−55% probability to the risk of a US recession in 2023. We compare this tightening cycle to past tightening cycles and explain that although a recession is possible, it is not inevitable. We explain why staying invested in such an uncertain environment is our recommended course of action. In a March 2009  Sunday Night Insight  titled  Near-Term Pain, Long-Term Gain , we quoted the highly respected investor Seth Klarman of Baupost, who wrote: “To maintain a truly long-term view, investors must be willing to experience significant short-term losses; without the possibility of near-term pain, there can be no long-term gain. The ability to remain an investor (and not become a day-trader or a bystander) confers an almost unprecedented advantage in this environment.” 9 
  Next, we spell out our one- and five-year expected returns and review our opportunistic tactical tilts coming into 2023.

 Assessing the Risk of a US Recession 
 we have assigned a probability range of 45–55% to the risk of a US recession in 2023. A midpoint of 50% and a 10-percentage-point range reflect the uncertainty of our forecast. A recession is not our base case, and our investment recommendations are based on this 45–55% probability. Since we at ISG started publishing recession probabilities, we have been quite unequivocal about our forecasts. As shown in

 Exhibit 3, our probabilities have ranged from a low of 10% to a high of 30%. Our recession probability for 2022 was 10%. Since the global financial crisis (GFC), we have never forecast a recession, and except for the brief pandemic-induced recession, the US economy has not experienced one since then. When we have felt more uncertainty about our probabilities, we have used a five-percentage-point range, as we did in our 2019 and 2020  Outlook  reports. A midpoint of 50% and a 10-percentage- point range, therefore, is unusual for us.  We have evaluated all our recession forecasting models, sought the input of best-in-class economists, and concluded that the tools and analyses that favor a recession in 2023 are as convincing as those that do not. We also have a wider probability range than usual because it has given us flexibility to adjust to incoming data. For example, favorable economic data such as declining inflation or declining job openings prompts us to lean toward the low end of our range, while less favorable data that points to an overheated economy and more aggressive Federal Reserve tightening prompts us to lean toward the high end of the range.  Despite finding ourselves in this difficult position, we are reassured by two observations.  First and foremost are Chair Powell’s comments, noted earlier, indicating that  
 it is just not knowable at this point whether we will have a recession or not. He also mentioned that FOMC decisions will “depend on the totality of incoming data” and decisions will be made “meeting by meeting.”10 As the FOMC members react to incoming data, their responses will increase or decrease the risks of recession.  Second is Canadian-American economist John Kenneth Galbraith’s comment, “One of the greatest pieces of economic wisdom is to know what you do not know.”  We have also incorporated additional noneconomic risks into our recession forecast. They include a new wave of COVID-19 spreading around the world as a result of China’s reopening, heightened geopolitical risks emanating from Russia and debt ceiling negotiations in the US sometime in the second half of 2023. While each of these risks individually may not throw a well- balanced economy into recession, two or more in conjunction with continued Federal Reserve tightening of monetary policy are likely to do so. We review those risks later in this report.  
 Key Arguments in Favor of a  US Recession  
 The most compelling and most frequently cited rationale for predicting a recession in 2023 is the speed of tightening conducted by the Federal Reserve and the subsequent tightening of financial conditions. As the Federal Reserve tightens monetary policy by raising the federal funds rate and reducing the size of its balance sheet, financial conditions are tightened as: 
 • Interest rates rise across the Treasury yield curve. • The incremental cost of borrowing across businesses and households increases. • Equity markets decline, creating a negative wealth effect in which consumers reduce consumption as they become less wealthy.

 • The dollar appreciates relative to other currencies, lowering exports as the cost of US goods rises for non-US-dollar importers.  
 As we discussed in last year’s  Outlook  report,  Piloting Through , not every Federal Reserve hiking cycle and subsequent tightening of financial conditions has resulted in a recession. Of 15 hiking cycles in the post-WWII period, only nine, or 60% of the cycles, did so. The cycles that led to recessions can be differentiated from those that did not by some combination of the magnitude of tightening and the pace of tightening.  As shown in Exhibit 4, the magnitude of policy tightening over the past 10 months has been the greatest and the pace has been the fastest on record since the stagflation of the 1970s and early 1980s. That period was marked by a ninefold increase in the price of oil from about $4 per barrel before the Arab oil embargo to about $40 per barrel after the Iranian Revolution and Iran-Iraq War. CPI reached 14.8% in March 1980, and core CPI reached 13.6% in June of the same year.11 In the current cycle, CPI peaked at 9.1%; core CPI peaked at 6.6%.  The tightening of financial conditions was equally severe in 2022. As shown in Exhibit 5, from its trough in November 2021, the Goldman Sachs US Financial Conditions Index increased by more than four percentage points. This was the biggest tightening in 11 months since the GFC. It  
 was driven by the rapid increase in interest rates, the increase in the incremental yield (also known as the spread) in corporate bonds, the drop in equity prices and the large appreciation of the dollar. The best example of the impact of tighter financial conditions is the change in residential mortgage rates. Mortgages rates increased from 3.11% at the beginning of the year to a peak of 7.08% in late October, reflecting the combined impact of an increase in Treasury interest rates and an increase in spreads. Such high mortgage rates lowered homeownership affordability to levels below those of the GFC (see Exhibit 6). A decline in home prices, as measured by the Case-Shiller national home price index, followed, as shown in Exhibit 7.  As we noted earlier, history is a useful guide. It shows that since WWII, such significant tightening in a short time has always led to a recession. History, however, is less helpful in telling us when a recession might unfold. The number of months from when a hiking cycle has begun to when a recession has begun has ranged from 11 to 43, with an average of 30 months and a median of 31.  The tightening in this cycle started in March 2022. Taking the historical experience at face value, that start date implies a recession could start as early as the first quarter of 2023 or as  late as the fourth quarter of 2025. With such a wide range of potential recession start dates— and the fact that the historical average and median

As we will discuss later in this section, our one- and five-year expected returns result in attractive portfolio returns. It is also not prudent to stay on the sidelines by being invested in cash for 30 months or longer and risk forgoing those attractive portfolio returns.  A model developed by Eric Engstrom and Steven Sharpe, two economists at the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, referred to as the Engstrom-Sharpe model, supports the view that a recession is likely but not imminent. The model looks at the spread between the interest rate on a 3-month Treasury bill in 18 months as priced by the Treasury market, and the current interest rate for a 3-month Treasury bill. That model assigns a 70% probability to a recession unfolding in 12 months— so a recession is likely in 2024. The model assigned a 1% probability in early 2022.  Our ISG models also suggest a recession is likely. Our most reliable—but not foolproof— model is the ISG Yield Curve Inversion Diffusion Index, which looks at four yield curves over daily, weekly and monthly frequencies. When the index has reached 100%, meaning all the yield curve inversions have been triggered, a recession has followed all nine times except in 1965 (see Exhibit 8). This index triggered a recession signal when it reached 100% on July 25, 2022.  
  Although this index has a reliable 89% hit ratio (percentage of time it has been successful), the time to recession after the index was triggered has been bimodal. As shown in Exhibit 9, the recession has typically started either about seven months or 1.5 to two years after the trigger date. The likelihood of a recession within seven months of the trigger date, in this case by February 2023, is low. A more

 likely scenario is a recession in 2024, according to this indicator.  Another ISG model, the ISG Recession Scorecard, has not yet breached the elevated recession risk level of 65. As shown in Exhibit 10, the level stands at 62. The scorecard combines a series of leading indicators such as the Conference Board Leading Economic Index, the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) Manufacturing Index of new orders minus inventories, and initial jobless claims, as well as a series of National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) recession indicators such as the average of payroll and household employment and industrial production. In other words, this scorecard follows many of the indicators that have prompted most economists to forecast a recession.  One important consideration when using such models is that no economic forecasting model has a perfect track record that can predict the occurrence and, more importantly, the timing of a recession.  In a recent book titled  Escape from Model Land: How Mathematical Models Can Lead Us Astray and What We Can Do About It , Erica Thompson, senior policy fellow at the London School of Economics Data Science Institute and a fellow of the London Mathematical Laboratory, warns that too great a reliance on models “can have catastrophic effects because it invariably results in an underestimation of uncertainties  
 and exposure to greater-than-expected risk.” 12  She recommends incorporating some judgment into projections so that one can have “greater confidence that those projections will prove trustworthy.”  Hence, we examine other factors that, in our judgment, point to a lower likelihood of recession than that shown by the models.

 Key Arguments Against a US Recession  
 We now consider four factors suggesting the US economy may be able to avoid a recession: a balanced economy, a shorter lag of policy tightening, declining inflation and the possibility of fewer Federal Reserve hikes than are currently expected.  
 Balanced Economy  The US economy is even more balanced today than it was at the end of 2021. A more balanced economy is likely to absorb shocks much better than an imbalanced economy.  Exhibit 11 is a Financial Excess Monitor produced by our colleagues on the Goldman Sachs US Economics Research team. We have been using this tool since David Mericle, chief Goldman Sachs US economist, and the US Economics Research team created it in March 2018. It comprises 46 different measures, such as the housing-price- to-rent ratio, commercial real estate price index, credit card interest rates relative to the risk- free rate, incremental yield of corporate bonds, equity market valuations, personal savings rate, corporate debt-to-GDP growth rate, leverage in the financial sector, and federal and state government debt. The monitor highlights pockets of risks in the US economy and financial markets. Red signifies excesses; blue signifies a well-balanced sector or metric. The monitor shows that all sectors improved in 2022 except for households/ consumers and housing, which showed a slight  
 deterioration. In aggregate, the US economy is more balanced today than it was a year ago: the total line is a light shade of blue rather than white.  Importantly, both the financial sector and the non-financial business sector improved—captured by the darker shades of blue. Some observers have expressed concern about the increase in debt levels in the non-financial corporate sector. As shown in Exhibit 12, non-financial corporate debt as a share of GDP stands at 49.7%, the highest it’s been since 1980 except for the pandemic-related spike. While this level may appear alarming, it does not seem

 so upon further examination. Most of the increase was driven by high-quality investment grade bond issuers that issued debt in order to take advantage of the low level of interest rates. The average coupon level of investment grade corporate debt is 3.7%, which is close to the lowest level since 1973. The median level of the interest coverage  
 ratio (the ratio of earnings before interest and tax payments to interest expense) for investment grade borrowers is at 7.0x, which is the highest since 1999.  As shown in Exhibit 13, the cost of servicing the debt as a share of income is the lowest since 1980, at 10.3%. Because most of the debt is fixed- rate and generally of longer maturity, an increase in interest rates does not have a material impact on the cost of servicing the debt. An increase of two percentage points in interest rates raises the cost of servicing the debt to 14.7%, still very low by historical standards.  We should note that while the level of imbalance in the households/consumer sector has deteriorated relative to the end of 2021, households still have significant excess savings, estimated at over $1.5 trillion. According to Bank of America data, households have savings and checking account balances that are still above pre-pandemic levels across all income cohorts, including lower-income and younger households. 13 
 Shorter Lag of Policy Tightening  According to a Financial Conditions Index growth impulse model developed by Mericle and his team, the drag on GDP growth from tightening of financial conditions occurs sooner than is typically thought by most market participants. 14  As a result, Mericle and his team estimate that the drag from

 the tightening of financial conditions will abate in 2023, as shown in Exhibit 14. 
 Declining Inflation  Inflation has peaked and is declining across many drivers:  
 • As shown in Exhibit 15, core goods inflation is expected to turn negative by the middle of 2023, and the GS Supply Chain Congestion Scale has reached its lowest level since the start of the pandemic (see Exhibit 16). • With respect to shelter inflation, which is about 40% of core CPI, both the Case-Shiller national home price index and the alternative measures of rent inflation have been declining, as shown in Exhibits 7 (referenced earlier) and 17. Due to the mechanics of how housing inflation is calculated, the current decline impacts official shelter inflation with a lag of as long as a year. Since policymakers are aware of this mechanical delay, they are likely to incorporate these contemporaneous measures of shelter inflation into their decision- making process. • Wages have been the most persistent source of inflation in 2022. However, we expect wage pressures to abate slowly as the number of job openings declines, the unemployment rate increases and lower headline inflation reduces the bargaining power for wage negotiations. Our colleagues in US Economics Research point to forward-looking indicators of wage growth such as monthly wage surveys and the  
 Indeed Wage Tracker (for job postings)—shown in Exhibit 18—as support for diminishing wage pressures.

 policy rates to 5−5.25%, we also recognize that there is a chance it will not raise rates as much as we expect. As shown in Exhibit 19, policy rates have typically peaked below the peak of where the market expects the yield on 1-year Treasury bills to be one year from now (1y1y). In the nine hiking cycles since 1972, there have been two exceptions:  
 1974 and 1980. In all other cases, the Federal Reserve hiked rates to a peak below the peak market pricing of 1y1y. In this tightening cycle, the peak to date for the 1y1y was 4.7% in early November. It stood at 4.2% at year-end. If this historical pattern repeats itself, the Federal Reserve may hike only one more time. Given that most of the impact of tighter financial conditions has already occurred, as shown earlier in Exhibit 14, it is possible that a recession will be averted.  Of course, there is a chance of further tightening beyond our expectations. Note in Exhibit 20 that the FOMC’s estimate for the federal funds rate in the December 2021 Summary of Economic Projections was materially below its most recent projections in December 2022. Even FOMC members do not have the proverbial crystal ball.  In summary, we think the probability of a recession in 2023 ranges from 45% to 55%. In Exhibit 21, we share the views of a panel of experts whom we have hosted on client calls; the lowest probability is from our colleagues on the GS US Economics Research team and the highest probability is from Bill Dudley. Jason Furman, professor of practice of economic policy jointly at Harvard Kennedy School and the Department of Economics at Harvard University and former chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, is at 55%, and Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics, is at 50%.  We have also provided probabilities for 2024. By definition, expanding the horizon to two years to estimate the probability of recession increases the probability. As shown in Exhibit 22, the cumulative probability of a recession if the economy is still in an expansion increases

 from 12% in one year to 24% in two years, a 12-percentage-point increase. Given the tightening of policy rates to date and the expected increases in 2023, we believe the probability of recession will still be elevated in 2024, and we therefore expect the cumulative probability to rise by 20 percentage points from 2023 to 2024.  We now turn to our analysis of 60/40 portfolios. We show why a stock/bond portfolio is still a compelling starting point and how diversifying the portfolio by adding certain asset classes and strategies provides the optimal strategic asset allocation.  
 60/40 Stock/Bond Portfolios 
 Following the negative returns of both stocks and bonds in 2022, several institutions have questioned the viability of 60/40 stock/bond portfolios. We should note that the term “60/40 stock/ bond portfolio” is used generically by the financial industry to mean a portfolio of stocks and bonds; it does not imply that a 60/40 mix is the right allocation for every client.  The  Financial Times  reports that “private capital titans insist that the traditional 60/40 investor allocation between listed stocks and bonds has been rendered useless by central bank  
 largesse correlating the entire market.” 15  Some asset management firms have suggested rethinking traditional stock/bond portfolios or having a “makeover.” Quite a few firms warn of a lost decade for 60/40 portfolios. Most recommend adding asset classes such as commodities and hedge funds to hedge against the positive correlation between stocks and bonds seen in 2022. Others have recommended adding factor-based investment strategies and active equity managers to improve performance.  This range of suggestions has prompted some clients to ask us whether they should change their strategic asset allocation. We do recommend clients reevaluate their strategic asset allocation on a regular basis, especially after a tumultuous year, to make sure that their portfolios are tailored to their risk tolerance, tax status and preferences. However, clients should not alter their strategic asset allocation simply in response to the noise around 60/40 portfolios.  Our reasoning is twofold: 
 • What transpired in 2022 in terms of negative returns for both bonds and stocks is a rare occurrence, and clients should not adjust portfolios solely because of a rare occurrence. We also find that positive correlations between stocks and bonds are common, and such correlations alone do not invalidate the value of 60/40 portfolios. There is no need to change asset allocation because of market performance in 2022. • ISG’s strategic asset allocation process uses a mix of stock/bond portfolios (60/40 or other mixes of stocks and bonds) as a launching pad. The 60/40 portfolio merely provides a reference benchmark: many asset classes are added to a client’s portfolio to improve the risk/return profile relative to a portfolio of only stocks and bonds. Of course, while we refer

 Frequency of Negative Returns in Stocks and Bonds  Negative returns in both stocks and bonds over any 12-month window have occurred only 2% of the time since 1926, as shown in Exhibit 23. We used the S&P 500 Index to represent stocks and the Bloomberg Barclays US intermediate 1- to 10-year Treasury index for bonds. About 67% of the time, both stocks and bonds provided positive returns; 23% of the time, stocks had a negative return partially offset by positive bond returns; and 8% of the time, stocks had a positive return partially offset by negative bond returns. In aggregate, the data covers 96 years of 12-month windows. A 60/40 portfolio produced a positive 12-month return 80% of the time, as shown in Exhibits 24 and 25.  Another challenge put forth by the naysayers to the viability of 60/40 portfolios has been the recent positive correlation between stocks and bonds. The correlation between stocks and bonds has been positive since August 2022. As shown in Exhibit 26, this correlation has varied over time. We have looked at both three-year and 10-year rolling windows. While the long-term average for both series is 0.04, there have been periods such as the 25-year window between 1975 and 2000 in which the average of three-year rolling correlations has been positive at 0.33, and periods such as the 22-year window between 2000 and 2022 when

 the average correlation has been negative at -0.33. The correlations over 10-year rolling windows exhibit the same pattern of positive and negative correlations.  The changing correlation between stocks and bonds, however, has no bearing on the viability of 60/40 portfolios.  Typically, investors expect bonds to provide some downside protection during large declines in equity prices. Bonds have done so even when the correlation between stocks and bonds has been positive. Exhibit 27 shows how bonds have had positive returns—albeit small returns at times— during equity market downdrafts, in effect partly hedging the returns of the portfolio even when the correlations were positive.  We conclude that negative returns for stocks and bonds and positive correlations between them  
 do not undermine the viability of 60/40 portfolios and should not deter clients from the use of stock/ bond benchmarks as a launching pad for strategic asset allocation.  
 The Last Decade Does Not Imply a Lost Decade  A 60/40 portfolio comprising the S&P 500 and the Bloomberg Barclays Intermediate Treasury Index generated an annualized return of 8.0% on a nominal basis and 5.3% on a real basis (adjusted for inflation) over the decade ending in 2022. This compares to an annualized portfolio return of 8.8% in nominal terms and 5.4% in real terms since 1926. What differentiates the returns of the past decade is that they were produced with a low annualized volatility of 8.8%, compared to volatility of 10.1% since 1926. As a result, the Sharpe ratio (a measure of the excess return above

 a risk-free rate per unit of risk) was particularly attractive.  We expect benchmark returns to be lower over the next five and 10 years. ISG’s Tactical Asset Allocation team expects, based on fundamental analysis, a 6.3% annualized total return for a 60/40 portfolio over the next five years. The team does not provide 10-year portfolio forecasts. The Strategic Asset Allocation team expects, based  
 on long-term returns driven by its multi-factor model, a 6.2% annualized total return over the next decade.  Building a diversified portfolio based on the reference portfolio is expected to add another 0.75 to 1.0 percentage point to returns, as we discuss below. 
 Diversified Model Portfolios Built Upon a Reference Portfolio of Stocks and Bonds  Appropriate diversification is another pillar of ISG’s investment philosophy. We recommend diversifying assets away from generic stocks and bonds into other assets, but only if those assets improve the risk/return profile of a portfolio.  For example, one can improve the return and Sharpe ratio of a portfolio by adding high yield securities and illiquid assets such as private equity, real estate and infrastructure to it. We recommend a very limited allocation to hedge funds. As shown in Exhibit 28, diversification into these other assets is expected to add about 0.7 percentage point to annualized returns and improve the Sharpe ratio of an optimized portfolio from 0.43 to 0.51 relative to a 60/40 reference benchmark.  We believe that one can add value to portfolios by introducing certain long-term investment themes. For example, US Preeminence has been an investment theme since the inception of ISG. We recommend overweighting US equities and meaningfully underweighting emerging market assets. In a December 2022  Insight  on China titled  Middle Kingdom: Middle Income , we restated our

 view that diversified portfolios should overweight US assets and underweight emerging market assets and assets with significant exposure to China. In the interest of brevity, we refer you to that  Insight  for details.  We also recommend avoiding certain asset classes that do not improve the risk/return profile of a portfolio. Among certain strategic asset allocation advisors, commodities—especially oil, natural gas and gold—have become a frequently recommended asset to add to a portfolio given the increase in inflation as well as the strong returns of the energy sector in 2022.  We strongly advise against such a strategic allocation. As explained in our January 2010  Insight  report,  Commodities: A Solution in Search of a Strategy , neither gold, nor oil, nor commodities in aggregate improve the risk/return profile of a portfolio. At the time, the prevailing recommendation was to add commodities to portfolios. We did not agree. As shown in Exhibit 29, US equities have outperformed all key commodities since we published that report. We still do not recommend commodities, because they do not improve the risk/return profile of a portfolio and, notably, they are among the worst asset classes in outperforming inflation, as shown in Exhibit 30.  It is important to note that we differentiate between strategic and tactical asset allocation.  
 While we do not recommend commodities as part of a client’s strategic asset allocation, we have tactically allocated assets to commodities and commodity-related sectors and will continue to do so in the future.  US equities, in fact, are the most effective hedge against inflation relative to other asset classes. This asset class has had the highest frequency of  
 Exhibit 29: Total Return Since the ISG Commodities Insight Publication  Commodities have meaningfully lagged US equities since January 2010.

 outperforming inflation over any period between one and 20 years, as shown in Exhibit 30.  We conclude that a 60/40 portfolio is still a good starting point upon which to build a fully diversified portfolio. A year of negative returns in both asset classes, positive correlations and lower forward returns compared to returns in the prior decade do not negate the benefits of a portfolio that is composed primarily of stocks and bonds and has been supplemented by other asset classes.  As Sir John Templeton, American-British investor, wrote, “the four most expensive words in the English language are ‘This time it’s different.’” 16  When market participants say this time is different and suggest that we are entering a new regime in which 60/40 stock/bond portfolios no longer work, we are reminded of Templeton’s comment and remain confident that history is a useful guide: this time is not that different from past periods of underperformance of stock/bond portfolios and positive correlations.  Since we expect returns for the next one, five, and 10 years to be attractive, we recommend clients stay invested at a well-diversified strategic asset allocation that is in line with their risk tolerance. We now turn to our one- and five-year expected returns across publicly traded asset classes and make the case for staying invested despite the heavy fog ahead. 
 Our One- and Five-Year Expected Total Returns 
 Given the probability of 45−55% that we have assigned to a US recession, with a midpoint at 50%, we are also assigning a 50% probability to the base case scenario of our expected returns across the major publicly traded asset classes. We are assigning a higher probability to the downside scenarios, given the combined risks of recession and geopolitical flare-ups around the world. This is the lowest probability we have given our base case scenario and the highest probability we have given our downside scenario since the GFC (see Exhibit 31).  Our expected returns are driven by our estimates of: 
 • Below-trend global growth of 2.4% in 2023, consisting of 1.2% growth in the US, mild recessions in the Eurozone and the UK, anemic growth in Brazil, below-trend growth in India  
 and a recession in Russia because of the war in Ukraine. While our base case for China is a post-COVID economic recovery of 4.9%, the risks are tilted to the downside if the disorderly exit from COVID—which  The Economist  has referred to as “China’s COVID failure”—saps consumer and business confidence. • Mid-single-digit earnings growth in the US; flat earnings in Japan; and declining earnings in the Eurozone, the UK and emerging markets. • Slightly lower interest rates in the US, Europe and the UK; a modest increase in rates in Japan; and a very small decline in rates in emerging markets. 
 Exhibit 31: Base and Bear Case Probabilities for S&P 500 Year-End Price Scenarios in ISG Outlooks  Our base case probability for the S&P 500 is the lowest since the GFC while that of our bear case is the highest.

 • A negligible increase in the US dollar of 1−2%, and modest decreases in emerging market currencies. 
 As shown in Exhibit 32, we expect US and Eurozone equities to be the best-performing asset classes in 2023, with total returns in local currency of about 13% in our base case scenario. We expect returns of 12% for the MSCI All Country World Index. Such strong equity returns, if realized, will result in moderate-risk model portfolio returns of 9.0% for taxable clients and 9.8% for tax-exempt clients. As mentioned earlier, we assign a probability of 50% to our base case scenario.  We assign a probability of 30%, much higher than usual, to our downside scenario across all equity markets. However, in the US, the full-year returns in our downside scenario are relatively muted, at -4%, because US equities already declined 18% in 2022. Valuations declined from 21.4x consensus earnings at the beginning of 2022 to 17.4x by the end of the year.  In our upside scenario, we expect equities to increase by as much as 27% due to lower inflation, above-trend growth in the US and higher multiples as investors are relieved that recession risks have abated. We assign a 20% probability to that case, as shown in Exhibit 33.  We estimate that our one- and five-year return expectations will be realized even if we have a mild US recession that ends this year.  
  The most important question to address for clients is why we recommend they stay invested at their strategic asset allocation given the 45−55% probability of recession and 30% probability of our downside scenario.

  First and foremost, while we have assigned a 30% probability to a muted -4% return for the full year, we have assigned a 70% probability of S&P 500 returns of 13% or higher. The skew of expected returns by the end of 2023 is to the upside, based on our analysis.  Second, ISG’s framework for underweighting equities in the face of a high probability of recession requires that equity markets have not declined more than 10%. As shown in Exhibit 34, if the probability of recession is high—which it is currently—but the equity market has already declined significantly, it is too late to underweight equities; in fact, we look for opportunities to overweight equities, either directly or through options.  Our framework to underweight equities in anticipation of a recession is based on post-WWII history showing equity markets do not typically discount recessions more than six months in advance. What transpired in 2022 was unusual on multiple fronts—not just because having a year with negative returns for both stocks and bonds has occurred only 2% of the time since 1926.   Other rare occurrences also materialized last year. As mentioned earlier, our most historically reliable leading indicator for detecting a future recession, our Yield Curve Inversion Diffusion Index, triggered a recession signal on July 25, 2022. At that time, US equities had already declined 17% from peak levels earlier in the year. Typically,  
 equities have declined by low- to mid-single digits at the time of past signals, allowing time for defensive portfolio adjustments (see Exhibit 35). The largest decline prior to 2022 was 9%. So underweighting equities after a decline of 18% in 2022 is not prudent given our view that a recession is not a certainty and the fact that a significant market decline preceded the recession signal in this cycle.  Similarly, the equity market has rallied after the start of every Federal Reserve tightening cycle that led to a recession. As shown in Exhibit 36, the S&P 500 has rallied after the beginning of all tightening cycles by anywhere from 4% to 85%, with an average of 40% and a median of 34%. (We have included the tightening cycle that started in 2015, even though the pandemic triggered the following recession.) Therefore, the beginning of a tightening cycle is not reason enough to underweight equities. In 2022, the equity market had already declined 10% by the time of the first hike by the Federal Reserve in March.  It is very unusual for financial conditions to tighten as much as they did in 2022 before the Federal Reserve raises rates.  The third reason we recommend clients stay invested at their strategic asset allocation is that portfolio returns after a year of negative returns— such as we had in 2022—tend to be higher than long-term averages in the following 12 and 24 months. We shared some of this analysis in defense of 60/40 portfolios. Here we examine the data for

 moderate-risk portfolios that are benchmarked against 50/50 stock/bond portfolios because that benchmark is more commonly used by our clients. We note the following: 
 • As shown in Exhibit 37, negative returns for a moderate-risk portfolio occur only 18% of the time. • Typically, as shown in Exhibit 38, the market’s subsequent returns outperform long-term averages after a big decline. For example, in the post-WWII period, the total return of a 50/50 portfolio was 10.6% in the 12 months following a negative return, compared to the average annual return of 8.9%. The returns are even more compelling over 24 months. • Of course, positive returns do not always follow 12 or 24 months later. During the Great Depression, a moderate-risk portfolio would have experienced a cumulative drawdown of 53% for 2.8 years. A moderate-risk portfolio took 3.6 years to recover to prior peak levels, as shown in Exhibit 39. • In the post-WWII period, there have been three periods in which above-average returns have not followed a year of negative returns in a moderate-risk portfolio: the 1973−74 Arab- Israeli War and Arab oil embargo, the dot-com bubble, and the GFC. We do not believe those periods are likely to be repeated:  
  –  Monetary policy discipline was very different in the early 1970s, oil prices increased by nearly 2.5 times and inflation expectations became unanchored. 
  –  In the dot-com bubble period, equity valuations were significantly higher. The red diamonds in Exhibit 40 indicate valuations at the peak

 for exiting and then reentering the market must be excellent. For example, if a hypothetical New York City taxpayer sold equities at the beginning of 2022 and remained out of the market, the taxes paid on a dollar invested in 2009 would necessitate a market decline of 32% from the beginning of 2022 just to break even. Taxes paid on a dollar invested midway between 2009 and the pre-COVID market peak would require a market decline of 18% just to break even.  
 Finally, our recommendation to stay invested is also driven by the general upward trend of US equities. As shown in Exhibit 46—an exhibit that is familiar to our long-standing clients—US equities are driven by earnings in the US economy, which are upward-trending except for recessions. Downdrafts pass and portfolios recover. On average, it has taken 10 months for moderate-risk portfolios to recover; the median time to recovery is eight months, as shown in Exhibit 47. We recommend staying invested because the risk of missing out on an increase in equities is far greater than a short-term mark-to-market risk that will eventually dissipate.  We recommend clients stay invested at their full strategic asset allocation. We acknowledge that we made the same recommendation in our 2022  Outlook  report,  Piloting Through . We believe that if our 2023 expected returns are realized,  
 our recommendation to stay invested will have served our clients well. Interestingly, even if we had exited equities early in January 2022 and stayed in cash waiting for the fog of recession risk and other geopolitical risks to lift, our taxpaying clients might not have broken even. They would have paid more in taxes than they would have saved in the market decline.  We now turn to our tactical tilts, which provided some incremental portfolio return to clients that used them in 2022, and review our tilts in place at the beginning of 2023.  
 Our Tactical Tilts 
 A tumultuous year in financial and commodity markets presented the tactical asset allocation team with significant opportunities to add value to clients’ portfolios. Volatility was nearly double that of 2021 as measured by the S&P 500, and about 80% higher as measured by the MSCI ACWI. At peak levels, we had 22 individual tactical tilts in 2022, compared to a long-term average of 10 tilts a year.  Typically, these tactical tilts have been funded from fixed income assets and driven by attractive valuations and market dislocations. Volatile markets tend to provide more market dislocations, which, in turn, provide more opportunities for tactical asset allocation.

  We estimate that these tilts added about 50 basis points to a taxable moderate-risk portfolio in 2022, outperforming intermediate Treasury and municipal bonds. The overall volatility of the tilts was 5.1%, and the beta to the S&P 500 was 0.18. Despite the positive beta to the S&P 500— which dropped about 18% for the year—the tilts produced a positive total return.   
 S&P 500 Option Strategies: One of the most effective strategies in 2022 for taking advantage of increased volatility was using options to augment the returns of a fully invested portfolio.  The strategy is based on two tenets: 
 • Volatility tends to revert to its long-term average over time. If volatility spikes because of events such as the GFC, the pandemic or the Russian invasion of Ukraine, it eventually comes back toward its long-term average of about 20 as measured by the VIX. During the early months of the pandemic, for example, volatility reached 85. In 2022, it peaked at 39 intraday and ended the year at 22, as shown in Exhibit 48. When volatility is high, options increase in value, and that may be an opportune time to sell options. When volatility is low, that may be an opportune time to buy options. • We tend to use options to enhance the risk/ return profile of a portfolio when we believe that buying or selling the underlying asset is  
 a riskier strategy. For example, if volatility is high and we can collect an attractive premium by selling a put option, that may be more attractive than buying the asset outright. Sometimes, we use a combination of options,  as we did in 2022.  
 In 2022, we had a total of nine put and call option tactical tilts on the S&P 500. In aggregate, they produced a total return of 3.2% net of transaction

 costs, with a volatility of 6%, compared to the total return of the S&P 500 of -18%, total return of intermediate Treasuries of -8% and total return of intermediate municipal bonds of -5%.  While we do not have any such S&P 500 options as a tactical tilt in early 2023, we expect this to be an effective tactical asset allocation strategy this year, as spikes in volatility are likely given the uncertainty ahead with respect to the US economy and geopolitical tensions.  As of year-end 2022, we had six tactical tilts, which is below our average number of tilts and is the lowest level of risk allocated to such tilts over the last decade.  
 Overweight 2-Year Treasuries: We initiated a tactical tilt to a constant-maturity 2-year Treasury early in 2022. At the time, our view was that 2-year Treasury rates were already discounting Federal Reserve tightening to such an extent that the tilt was likely to provide a positive return. We still expect the tilt to provide a positive return, especially as 2-year Treasury rates ended 2022 at 4.4%. Given our view of economic growth at 1.2% and the federal funds rate peaking at 5−5.25%, we expect this tilt to provide a mid-single-digit return in 2023. 18   
 Overweight US Energy Infrastructure Master Limited Partnerships: The allocation to master limited partnerships (MLPs) has been one of our longest-standing tactical tilts. It was initiated as an option tilt in 2015 and changed to a long sector position in January 2016. This tilt has an inception-to-date return of 37% and has been one of our most volatile tilts. The MLP sector was up nearly 30% in 2022, compared to the S&P 500 at -18%. While we have reduced the allocation to this tilt given its strong performance over the last two years, we still retain an allocation, for the following reasons: 
 • Valuations are still attractive even after such strong returns. Valuations as measured by the ratio of enterprise value to EBITDA are one standard deviation below their long-term average due to continued strong earnings (see Exhibit 49). • Corporate management has continued to be disciplined about capital expenditures, with 2022 levels about 3.9% below 2021 levels. 2023 levels are expected to be flat to slightly lower. 
 • The tax-advantaged distribution yield of 8% is attractive compared to fixed income and high yield rates. The companies in the Alerian MLP Infrastructure Index generate 1.8x free cash flow relative to distributions, so the distribution yield appears secure. • We expect returns in the low 20s in 2023. 
 We note that we removed our S&P 500 energy sector tilt in October 2022 as the sector had rallied 63%, following a 55% total return in 2021. The energy sector had outperformed the S&P 500 by 83 percentage points when we removed the tilt. We removed the tilt because it had reached fair value on a normalized price-to-earnings basis, given oil prices in the futures market.  
 Overweight Eurozone Banks: We have maintained our tactical tilt to Eurozone banks at a reduced allocation. This is also among our longest-standing tilts, initiated in June 2018. And very much like our MLP tilt, it has been very volatile. It outperformed the European markets in both 2021, with a total return of 42%, and 2022, with a total return of 2%. We retain this allocation for the following reasons: 
 • Rising rates will improve the banks’ net interest margins and overall profitability. • We expect only a moderate rise in provisions despite our recession forecast for the Eurozone. Leverage has remained low, and two-thirds of the post-COVID increase in lending is covered

 by government guarantees. There are currently no signs of deterioration in asset quality, as shown in Exhibit 50. • The banks’ capital ratio is near record highs. • We expect a total return in the low 20s, composed of 6% dividend yield and multiple expansion as the price-to-book ratio increases from its current low level of 0.60x to 0.69x. As shown by the red triangle in Exhibit 51, that increase in price-to-book is a reasonable assumption.  
 Allocation to US Natural Gas Calendar Spread: As noted earlier, both European and US natural gas prices gyrated following the halting of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline and the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Fears of winter shortages of natural gas led US March 2023 contracts to become very expensive relative to April and trade at a historically high premium of over $1 per million BTU (see Exhibit 52)—a spread that had been wider only 9% of the time. This spread has typically contracted to $0.5 or less 95% of the time as the winter ends. The base case expected return on this trade was in the mid- to high teens, and we are rapidly approaching those levels.  
 Allocation to Physical Uranium: We initiated a small allocation to physical uranium in 2022. Nuclear energy is becoming an increasingly attractive source of electricity as countries seek  
 reliable, carbon-free and secure sources of energy. Some view nuclear energy as a permanent solution and others as a transition source of energy away from hydrocarbons while waiting for the development of more renewable energy sources.  Nuclear energy has supplied about 20% of total annual US electricity since 1990. In 2020, nuclear energy supplied 69% of France’s electricity generation.

  There has been a sharp decrease in uranium exploration activity and in production from existing mines. Since 2018, mined supply has been insufficient to meet annual reactor requirements (see Exhibit 53), and utilities have accessed inventories and extended the enrichment process to extract more yield per unit of raw uranium.  As of December 31, 2022, the price for uranium was $48/lb. We estimate that prices need to reach $70 or higher to incentivize adequate future production. While we do not anticipate those levels in the near term, we think this tilt will have long-term attractive returns.  
 Allocation to Systematic Strategies: We deploy three systematic strategies to provide uncorrelated sources of incremental return to a portfolio: Systematic Upside Improvement Tilt (SUIT); Systematic Downside Mitigation Tilt (SDMT); and Trend-Based Rotation (TBR).  All three strategies were deployed at the beginning of 2022. We removed the first two strategies after high-single-digit returns but have left the TBR strategy as a tactical tilt for 2023. This strategy was introduced in 2021. The goal is to rotate among 10 asset classes: US and non- US equity indices, gold, US corporate bonds, US Treasury bonds and US cash. The strategy is driven by the trend in each asset class, its volatility and the likelihood the trend will reverse course once  
 it has become extended. The strategy is based on the momentum factor and is a diversified strategy for ISG’s more value-oriented tactical tilts. We generally expect the strategy to deliver a high- single-digit return.  
 Role of Growth Stocks in Driving Equity Returns: Our tactical tilts generally have had a value orientation. Since the inception of ISG, we have had only a handful of growth-oriented tactical tilts. In total, our tactical tilts have provided incremental return to the strategic asset allocation process. Avoiding growth-oriented sectors did not hamper our performance, or that of the S&P 500.  One of the questions clients most frequently ask us concerns the role of a limited basket of stocks like the FANGMANT stocks, or the technology or communication sector stocks, in driving equity returns since the GFC. When we share our view that the return of the S&P 500 has been broad- based, clients are often surprised. As shown in Exhibit 54, the FANGMANT stocks represent 20% of the weight in the S&P 500 Index, down from a peak of 29% in November 2021.  The most straightforward way to show that a handful of growth stocks with large weights in the S&P 500 have not driven the index returns is to compare these returns using market capitalization weights to those of an equal-weighted index of stocks, where value stocks like Exxon, with

 a 1.4% weight, and Coca-Cola, with a 0.8% weight, are given the same weight as Apple Inc., which has a 6.0% weight, and Microsoft, which has a 5.6% weight in the market capitalization- weighted index.  We have analyzed the data through the end of 2021 and end of 2022. We present below the returns of the two benchmarks for four periods: since March 2000, the peak of the dot-com bubble; since the trough of the GFC; and over the last five and the last 10 years. We focus on the data ending in 2021 because these stocks did extremely poorly in 2022 and we do not want clients to discount the analysis because of that poor performance. Late 2021 also marks the peak weight of the basket of FANGMANT stocks in the S&P 500 Index. This basket of stocks declined 40% in 2022.  Since 2000 and since the trough of the GFC, the equal-weighted index outperformed the market capitalization index by 2.21 and 0.94 percentage points, respectively, on an annualized basis. Over the decade ending in 2021, the market capitalization-weighted index outperformed by 0.92 percentage point. The outperformance increased to 2.75 percentage points over the five years ending in 2021, and that includes the strong outperformance during the pandemic (see Exhibit 55).  If the returns had been driven by a basket of growth-oriented stocks alone,  
 the equal-weighted index would have lagged the market capitalization-weighted index significantly over all periods.  An alternative approach is to look at the total return across all S&P 500 Index sectors. As shown in Exhibit 56, the information technology sector outperformed after the trough of the GFC. However, financials, industrials and health care all outperformed the broader market.  While our US Preeminence theme is not reflected in a tactical asset allocation tilt, it is a strategic asset allocation overweight. As shown in Exhibits 57–72, the US is preeminent across most metrics that underpin economic growth, superior earnings growth and greater resilience. Should some of the risks other than recession that we have outlined in the next section materialize, this resilience will be paramount. Even so, these risks could derail our 2023 outlook.

 Additional Risks to Our Outlook 
 We face significantly greater risks in 2023 than we did in 2022:  • In 2022, we assigned a 10% probability of recession in the US; we have increased that probability to 45−55% for 2023. • We wrote that the late Ash Carter, former US secretary of defense, had assigned a 50% probability to the risk of a Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Now, not only has that happened, but we are facing risk of escalation, including attacks on infrastructure beyond Ukraine’s borders and a nonzero probability of tactical nuclear weapon deployment. • We wrote that US-China relations were going to be a source of uncertainty and volatility for the indefinite future; China became more aggressive in both its policy statements and its military activities in 2022. • With respect to North Korea, we wrote that we were least worried about rising tensions in 2022, but now we are worried about Kim Jong Un’s more aggressive posture toward missile testing and North Korea’s nuclear capabilities. • We wrote about two risks with respect to Iran: continued development of its nuclear program and its extensive missile program. The risks are even greater now given Iran’s further enrichment of its uranium and its new military partnership with Russia. • On COVID, we highlighted the risks of a more transmissible variant and risks to supply chains from China’s “zero-COVID” policy. The risks from COVID are unchanged. The new XBB.1.5 omicron subvariant has become the dominant variant in parts of the US, and China’s disorderly abandonment of its “zero-COVID” policy may create another surge of infections in other parts of the world. • We did not cite US midterm elections as a risk in 2022. However, the US will be a source of volatility in the second half of 2023: US debt ceiling negotiations are likely to be contentious and lead to market volatility, as they have in the past.  
 In aggregate, we think the risks to our economic and financial market outlook are greater than in 2022.  We begin with the geopolitical risks, since the recession risks were discussed earlier. We have  
 consulted on these risks with Andrew Bishop, senior partner and global head of policy research at Signum Global Advisors; Ian Bremmer, president and founder of Eurasia Group; General Sir Nick Carter, former chief of the Defence Staff in the UK; Bernie Haykel, professor of Near Eastern studies at Princeton University; and Sir Alex Younger, former chief of the Secret Intelligence Service in the UK and regional advisor at Goldman Sachs.  
 Ukraine-Russia War  The base case for most of the geopolitical advisors we have consulted with is a war that will last well beyond 2023. There is no face-saving off-ramp for President Vladimir Putin, and Ukraine cannot readily come to the negotiating table after the war crimes committed by the Russians against men, women and children, and the extensive damage to civilian structures and infrastructure.  The greatest risk is escalation by the Russians:  
 • Russian could become more aggressive, targeting infrastructure such as undersea cables and pipelines outside Ukraine. • Russia could launch cyberattacks globally. • Russia, most importantly, could use its nuclear capabilities.  
  –  Russia has the ability to use the ruse of a “dirty bomb” as a false flag somewhere near the Russian border to undermine Ukraine’s position, according to General Sir Nick Carter. 19 
  –  It could use a small-scale tactical nuclear weapon with limited explosive yield in Ukraine. 
  –  It could use a nuclear weapon to generate a high-altitude electromagnetic pulse that would damage electronics and communication systems. 
 The geopolitical advisors we have consulted with expect the Ukraine- Russia war to last well beyond 2023.

 According to Bremmer, the US has told Russia that if it were to deploy a nuclear weapon, the US would directly target Russian forces. 20  Theoretically, that warning should be a sufficient deterrent to President Putin. However, Sir Alex warns that “we cannot rely on Putin to act rationally. He has a higher readiness to accept risk.” 21  Bremmer has assigned a 5% probability to use of nuclear weapons.  Financially, Russia can afford to prolong this war through 2023 and possibly through 2024. We base this assessment on a series of assumptions, such as:  
 • A modest GDP decline in Russia of 3% in 2022 relative to high-single-digit drop expectations • Equally modest GDP decline of 2.6% in 2023 • Oil and gas exports continuing at year-end 2022 levels • China and India continuing to import 24% and 11%, respectively, of Russia’s export of crude oil and refined products • Russia’s ability to issue bonds domestically and tap oligarchs, their companies and the sovereign wealth fund, which has an estimated $186 billion in assets  
 One factor constraining how long Russia can continue the war is its supply of artillery ammunition. Admiral Sir Tony Radakin has said that “Russia faces critical shortages of artillery  
 munitions,” 22  and US officials have made similar statements. The Wagner Group, a Russian mercenary company, has also complained about the lack of ammunition. 23  Others have countered that Russia can tap into Soviet-era stockpiles and import ammunition from North Korea.  Finally, a cutoff of the West’s military, financial and humanitarian support to Ukraine would increase the likelihood that Ukraine would be forced to negotiate a settlement of some kind. While some have questioned the resolve of the US and Europe, it appears that their resolve has only strengthened. Ukraine has received increasing funds, more sophisticated military equipment and stronger statements of support from most Western leaders.  Europe is also under limited pressure to resume imports of natural gas from Russia. Germany, in less than a year from the start of construction, inaugurated its first floating liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal in Wilhelmshaven, and accepted its first shipment of LNG from the US. The terminal can process close to 6% of Germany’s 2021 consumption level. Coincidentally, the US is fast becoming the largest exporter of LNG, as shown in Exhibit 73. In 2022, it matched Qatar’s exports, and it is expected to exceed Qatar’s level once the Freeport export plant in Texas returns to full production after a June 2022 fire.

  The Ukraine-Russia war is likely to continue, and risks of escalation will contribute to market volatility.  
 US-China Tensions  As discussed extensively in our China  Insight  report,  Middle Kingdom: Middle Income , China has become more aggressive and assertive in its foreign policy toward the West. The US and its allies have responded by changing their national security strategies; they have introduced export and import controls such as the US Bureau of Industry and Security’s revision of export controls of high- end semiconductors and enhanced cybersecurity measures. Please see the report for a detailed discussion on this topic.  We think financial market volatility emanating from US-China tensions will ebb and flow. The meeting between Presidents Biden and Xi on November 14, 2022, in Bali, Indonesia, and the appointment of the Chinese ambassador to the US as foreign minister on December 30, 2022, have been interpreted as an improvement in US-China relations. On the other hand, a series of military activities in December 2022 have been interpreted as a more aggressive approach: 
 • The Japanese Ministry of Defense reported that between December 17 and December 27, the Chinese aircraft carrier  Liaoning  and its accompanying vessels sailed near the southernmost part of Japan and that there were numerous aircraft takeoffs that prompted Japan to scramble military aircraft and vessels. 24  The  Lianoning  and its task force also proceeded to within 400 miles of the US territory of Guam during this period, and Chinese media highlighted that Guam would be a target in a conflict scenario. • On December 21, the US Indo-Pacific Command reported that a People’s Liberation Army Navy fighter pilot “performed an unsafe maneuver during an intercept of a U.S. Air Force RC-135 aircraft … in international airspace … forcing the RC-135 to take evasive maneuvers to avoid a collision.” 25 
 • On December 25, China sent 71 warplanes into the vicinity of Taiwan, of which 47 crossed into Taiwan’s southwest air defense identification zone, prompting Taiwan’s military to respond with aircraft and navy vessels. The level of such incursions doubled in 2022 relative to 2021. 26   
 While US-China tensions and increased risks of military accidents in the air and the seas may contribute to market volatility, our panel of geopolitical advisors believe that the risk of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan is low in 2023. Most think it is unlikely over the next five years. However, Bishop from Signum Global Advisors

 North Korea  While we were not worried about North Korea’s activities spilling into financial markets in 2022, we think North Korea poses greater risks in 2023. As shown in Exhibit 74, North Korea has launched more missiles in 2022 than in the prior five years combined. The missiles have varied from short- range ballistic missiles to intercontinental ones. CIA Director William Burns has referred to it as “quite troubling,” and Bremmer has warned that “they’re going to test a nuke.” 27 
  Eurasia Group has also written that “the chances of conflict on the Korean peninsula are at their highest level since at least 2017 with fewer guardrails in place to promote de-escalation.” 28   
 China and Russia would have been the countries to place some guardrails on North Korea, but given the Ukraine-Russia war and rising geopolitical tensions between the US and China, those guardrails have been removed.  While risks of incidents between South Korea and North Korea are non-negligible in 2023, and missile tests could lead to interim volatility in the financial markets, the risk of serious military engagement with North Korea is low in the near term.  
 Iran  Iran poses two threats in 2023: producing weapons- grade uranium and making other irreversible advances in its nuclear program and expanding its weapons sales to Russia from drones to missiles.  
 Nuclear Concerns. According to data from the International Atomic Energy Agency and the analysis from the Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS), Iran already has highly enriched uranium (HEU) at 60% sufficient to be used for a nuclear weapon. 29  However, ISIS thinks Iran may prefer to enrich its 60% HEU to 90%, which is considered weapons-grade and more suited to Iran’s nuclear weapons designs.  General Sir Nick has suggested Iran will very likely have reinforced its view from observing the Ukraine war that there is merit is possessing a nuclear deterrent. 30  Sir Alex suggests that Iran’s leaders will not weaponize because their progress on enrichment “gives them enough leverage.” 31 
  Eurasia Group writes that Iran might decide to enrich to 90% when the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) restrictions on Iran’s development program of ballistic missiles designed to carry nuclear weapons expire in October 2023. 32

  Headlines from Iran on its nuclear program and responses from Israel will be a source of volatility in 2023.  
 Transferring Drones and Missiles to Russia. The new military relationship between Russia and Iran has been troubling to the West. Burns has said that “what’s beginning to emerge is at least the beginning of a full-fledged defense partnership between Russia and Iran, with the Iranians supplying drones to the Russians, which are killing Ukrainian civilians.” 33  In a joint statement after a United Nations Security Council meeting, France, Germany and the UK warned Iran “against any further deliveries of weapons to Russia, in particular of any short-range ballistic missiles, which would constitute a serious escalation.” 34 
  In our 2022  Outlook , we quoted Kenneth “Frank” McKenzie Jr., Marine general and commander of the US Central Command covering the Middle East and South Asia; he said that Iran had reached “overmatch” where its “strategic capacity is now enormous” and it has “the ability to overwhelm.” Its missiles “can strike effectively across the breadth and depth of the Middle East … with accuracy and volume.” 35  The joint statement warned that transferring such missiles to Russia would constitute an escalation. Escalation would lead to market volatility.  
 Cybersecurity  Cyberattacks remain a major threat from state and non-state actors, with the biggest threats emanating from China, Russia, Iran and North Korea.  US intelligence and national security agencies assess China’s state-sponsored cyber activities as presenting one of the largest and most dynamic threats to US government and civilian networks.  
 The Office of the Director of National Intelligence considers Russia a significant threat given its focus on critical infrastructure, including underwater cables and industrial control systems, in the US and in allies and partner countries. 36   Use of ransomware is on the rise as well and will continue increasing in 2023. Australia will lead a global ransomware task force starting in January 2023 to develop safeguards for advanced economies, but the benefits of such a task force will not be immediate.  
 Terrorism  Our panel of experts believe that the risk of terrorism is unchanged from 2022. They cite the absence of charismatic leaders and the lack of command and control under which terror groups could operate from the Middle East, including in Afghanistan. With limited state sponsorship, terror groups cannot get adequate funding to organize and pull off major terrorist acts in the West.  General Sir Nick has warned that there is a real possibility of terrorism being exported on the back of migration from Africa. The assessment of the Combating Terrorism Center at West Point is that the threat of terrorism from Africa and the Middle East is more local and cross-border within the region than global, with “Africa emerging as the world’s leading terrorism hotspot.” 37 
 COVID-19  COVID-19 risks in advanced economies are unchanged from last year. A new omicron subvariant, XBB1.5, has become the dominant variant in the US Northeast and could be responsible for the current surge. However, holiday travel and the winter may also be contributing to the surge. This variant appeared in Singapore in the fall.  The new variant has been described as immune-evasive: the virus is less likely to be neutralized by antibodies from prior infection or vaccines. According to Dr. David Ho, professor of microbiology and immunology at Columbia University, the level of immune evasion is “alarming.” 38  Our COVID-19 advisor, Dr. Luciana Borio, former director for medical and biodefense preparedness at the US National Security Council, believes that the new variant will cause many more infections, but that T cells from prior infections and vaccinations will limit serious disease and hospitalizations for most people. Cyberattacks remain a major threat from state and non-state actors.

  China is going through its massive first wave of COVID since the initial controlled surge in Wuhan in 2020. According to reports in the  Financial Times , Sun Yang, a deputy director at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), estimated that about 250 million people—or 18% of China’s population—were infected by COVID-19 in the first 20 days of December 2022. 39 
  Wu Zunyou, chief epidemiologist at the Chinese CDC, has suggested China will face three waves: the present one, a second one following the travel of hundreds of millions of people for the Lunar New Year starting on January 21, 2023, and a third one from late February to mid-March when people return to work from the New Year holidays. 40  The University of Washington’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation has estimated that China could see as many as 1 million COVID- related deaths. 41 
  Dr. Borio believes that the focus on variants emerging from China’s abandonment of its “zero- COVID” policy is understandable but not fully justified. While China’s removal of all COVID restrictions, including travel restrictions inside and outside China, may increase COVID infections outside China, we do not expect the risks to meaningfully affect the financial markets.  
 US Debt Ceiling  David Mericle and Alec Phillips, our colleagues in Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research, have highlighted raising the debt ceiling in 2023 as a significant risk to equity and bond markets. The debt ceiling limits how much debt the Treasury can issue to fund the US government and meet its coupon and principal payment obligations. The US is expected to reach its debt limit by August 2023, but it may be as late as October.  
  Mericle and Phillips suggest that the political and fiscal conditions this year will be similar to the conditions in 1995 and 2011, when the US had to raise the debt limit and the process was “extremely disruptive.” 42  In both those periods, a sitting Democratic president faced a Republican House which had won the majority after the midterm election, and federal debt as a share of GDP had increased at a more rapid pace. The “debt limit standoffs” between Republicans and Democrats led to increased market volatility in both periods. Prices of Treasury securities with maturities around the date of the debt ceiling dropped, and worries about a default increased.  Mericle and Phillips point out that the process to elect a speaker of the House provides some insight into how the debt ceiling negotiations may transpire.  We conclude that there is no shortage of risks that could derail our economic and financial market outlook.

 Key Takeaways 
 While we are facing a period of heightened uncertainty after a tumultuous 2022, we believe our two primary investment themes remain valid: US Preeminence and Staying Invested. US Preeminence leads us to overweight US assets in our strategic asset allocation. Staying Invested drives our recommendation that clients maintain their strategic asset allocation; that recommendation will change if we develop high conviction that a recession is imminent and not already discounted by the market. Currently, we do not have high conviction that a recession is imminent and one has already been partially discounted by the equity market decline.  
 The key takeaways from our 2023  Outlook  are as follows:  
 • Below-Trend Growth: We expect global economic growth to slow to below-trend levels. We believe the US will have modest growth; the Eurozone, the UK and Russia will be in recession; and that Japan will be an exception with above-trend growth. Large emerging market countries will grow below trend at mid-single-digit growth levels, in our view. We estimate China’s post-COVID recovery will reach 4.9%, just above trend levels of 4−4.5%. 
 • Monetary Policy Tightening: We believe that most major central banks will continue tightening monetary policy but at a more modest pace than in 2022. China will be a key exception as the leadership tries to stem the declines in the property sector. 
 • Recession Risk in the US: We have assigned a 45−55% range to the risk of recession in 2023. We believe the fog of uncertainty is too great to have much conviction on the direction of the US economy, and we therefore recommend clients position their portfolios neither for the certainty

 of recession nor for the certainty of modest growth in the US. The framework for staying invested is best captured by Exhibit 75. If the equity market has already largely discounted a recession, history has repeatedly shown that investors are better off staying the course given forward returns have typically been attractive.

 • Significant Geopolitical Risks: We face a much longer litany of geopolitical risks this year, including an escalation of the Russia-Ukraine war, high US- China tensions, more ballistic missile testing by North Korea, a growing partnership between Iran and Russia, continued nuclear enrichment in Iran and debt ceiling negotiations in the US.

 2023 Global Economic Outlook: A Difficult Balancing Act 
 SECTION I I 
 around the world, policymakers are attempting to cross a tightrope. For global central banks, the challenge is to lift interest rates high enough to dampen growth and bring down inflation, but not so high that they cause undue economic fallout. Similarly, governments are seeking to administer enough fiscal stimulus to help consumers cope with high prices but not so much that they stoke even worse inflation in the process. In both cases, leaning too far in either direction could be harmful.   To be sure, the risk of a misstep is high. Global central banks collectively delivered more than 280 interest rate hikes last year in response to inflation that was both higher and more persistent than expected. 43  Such forceful tightening of monetary policy clearly raises the risk of recession. At the same time, already stretched fiscal finances and fragile bond markets limit

 the scope for additional fiscal stimulus, as the negative reaction of the UK gilt market to the government’s expansionary budget last year reminds us. Additional stimulus is particularly constrained today because countries representing almost three-quarters of the world’s GDP have annual budget deficits greater than 4%. Europe and the UK alone have deployed more than $750 billion of fiscal stimulus to offset the impacts of the war in Ukraine. 44 
  Still, a sure-footed crossing can’t be ruled out. We place even odds on the US avoiding a recession this year, as households still have a savings cushion, and the US economy lacks the obvious cyclical excesses seen on the eve of past economic downturns. In Japan, the economy should continue to expand at an above-trend pace given still-accommodative policy, as well as considerable excess savings. Meanwhile, emerging markets as a group are likely to grow slightly faster than they did in 2022 as they benefit from China’s uneven reopening.  The Eurozone’s outlook, on the other hand, is shaky. Russia’s invasion of Ukraine put acute pressure on the region’s energy supplies and growth last year, likely causing a recession in the final months of 2022. The same could be said for the UK. But we expect relatively shallow recessions in both regions, as the economic slowdown thus far has been better than expected and a mild winter has helped cool energy prices.  Taken together, these factors support our forecast for a year of below-trend yet still positive global GDP growth (see Exhibit 76). 
 United States:  A Thorny Problem, Year Two 
 Inflation remains a thorn in the side of the US economy. As seen in Exhibit 77, headline CPI exceeded 9% at its apex last year, the highest level in four decades. That increase surpassed consensus forecasts by a wide margin for a second year in a row. But unlike 2021’s spike in goods prices, last year saw inflation expand to services as well (see Exhibit 78).  While external factors like the war in Ukraine and ongoing supply disruptions from China’s “zero-COVID” policy have put upward pressure

 on prices, inflation has emanated from within the US economy as well. As seen in Exhibit 79, various measures of the underlying trend of inflation remain well above the Federal Reserve’s 2% target. The same is true for wages, where demand for workers and a sluggish recovery in the labor force are stoking pay increases that are far outpacing productivity gains. As a result, there is much  
 greater risk that wage gains are directly fueling inflation in shelter and other cyclically sensitive sectors (see Exhibits 80 and 81).  Such persistently high inflation is a significant headwind to the US economy in at least three ways. First, it acts as a tax on consumers and erodes their real earnings. Second, it raises the hurdle for capital investment given a more uncertain future and higher

 funding costs. Lastly, it is incompatible with the Federal Reserve’s price stability mandate, obliging the bank to tighten monetary policy to dampen demand. Taken together, these effects slow economic growth and raise the risk of a recession.   These effects were clearly visible last year. As seen in Exhibit 82, real disposable personal income (DPI) was reduced by elevated inflation as well as the withdrawal of COVID stimulus  
 payments and higher taxes. At the same time, financial conditions tightened substantially (see Exhibit 83) in response to the Federal Reserve’s steepest hiking cycle since the early 1980s. The war-driven spike in energy prices only exacerbated these economic drags, which collectively took expected 2022 US GDP growth from around 4% at the start of the year to less than 2% by year-end (see Exhibits 84 and 85).

 55  Outlook  Investment Strategy Group 
  This abrupt economic slowdown comports with the Federal Reserve’s desire to bring inflation back to its target by engineering a period of below-trend growth. Our 2023 forecast of 1.2% real GDP growth—below the 1.5−2.0% estimates of trend growth—is consistent with that objective. We expect last year’s drop in net worth will dampen household spending (see Exhibit 86), as will a modest rise in unemployment. The same could be said for higher debt service payments, but still-healthy household balance sheets and the high proportion of fixed-rate debt are likely to keep those costs below their pre-pandemic levels (see Exhibit 87). Slower consumer spending is also expected to weigh on nonresidential business investment, while last year’s surge in mortgage rates should further reduce residential investment despite low homeowner vacancy rates (see Exhibit 88).  Although inflation has likely peaked, the pace of its descent remains a key source of debate. Of the three component categories on which the Federal Reserve focuses—goods, housing and services other than housing—we expect goods to exert the largest drag on core inflation this year, given already visible progress and improvements in supply chain bottlenecks (see Exhibits 89 and 90). Housing will take longer to adjust given the slow rate at which the stock of rental leases turns over. Yet the Federal Reserve is aware of these lags and  
 likely to look through them, especially since recent weakness in house prices and lease rates on new rentals imply a decline in housing inflation later this year (see Exhibit 91).  The trajectory of the third and largest category—services other than housing, which represent more than half of the core PCE index— is also the most uncertain. Wages represent the

 largest costs in delivering these services, and the labor market remains tight, with about 1.7 job openings for every person looking for work (see Exhibit 92). We expect only a modest increase in the unemployment rate, from 3.7% to 4.1%; hence we also forecast a more measured decline in core PCE inflation, to 3.6% by year-end. This is still far  
 enough above the Federal Reserve’s target to keep policy rates within 0.25% of 5% throughout 2023.  Of course, the tighter monetary policy and below-trend growth necessary to bring inflation down also raise the risk of recession.

 including our own Yield Curve Inversion Diffusion Index—have already triggered (see Exhibit 93). Moreover, most economists surveyed by Bloomberg expect a recession in 2023. 45 
  We certainly acknowledge this risk and place elevated 45−55% odds on a recession this year. But there are several reasons that recession is not our base case. First, we estimate households have around $1.5 trillion in excess savings after the largest increase in their holdings of cash and cash equivalents on record (see Exhibit 94). Even households in the bottom of the income distribution—which tend to be the most economically vulnerable—are benefiting from disproportionately strong wage gains (see Exhibit 95) that have enabled them to amass a savings buffer. As recent Federal Reserve research highlights, these “households in the bottom half of the income distribution still held (as of mid- 2022) roughly $350 billion in excess savings— about $5,500 per household on average,” which is sufficient to fully pay off  “their ‘liquid debt’ with room to spare.” 46  Second, real DPI is set to rebound this year as many of the drags from 2022—including higher gas prices, higher capital gains tax payments and lower transfer payments— abate (see Exhibit 96). Our GIR colleagues forecast real DPI will rise a solid 3.5% in 2023. Finally, as noted earlier, we expect only a modest rise in  
 unemployment, reflecting the still large number of job vacancies per unemployed worker. Without a strong negative feedback loop between job losses and reduced spending, it will be difficult for recession dynamics to take hold. However, recession risk may rise as we move through 2023, since these buffers are likely to erode over time.

 The Eurozone: About-Face 
 Russia’s invasion of Ukraine caused an abrupt decline in the Eurozone’s expected growth last year. Not only did the resulting surge in energy prices cause a sharp drop in real household disposable income (see Exhibit 97), but it also forced production cutbacks in energy-intensive industries, which hurt output. Although fiscal support helped to mitigate the economic impact of spiraling energy prices, central bank policy eroded that cushion as the ECB accelerated its hiking cycle to contain record-high inflation (see Exhibit 98).  While the economy held up better than feared, we think the combination of these headwinds likely pushed the Eurozone into recession in the final months of 2022. We expect a relatively shallow economic contraction barring a colder than normal winter, with a peak-to-trough real GDP decline of about 0.8%, but the recovery is likely to be sluggish. Several headwinds—including weak external demand, elevated energy prices and tight financial conditions—are set to constrain growth in the second half of this year. The same can be said for fiscal policy, which is expected to flip to a slight drag this year as COVID-related programs expire. All told, we expect the Eurozone economy to contract by 0.3% in 2023.  While this slowdown in economic activity— along with the easing of supply constraints and some moderation in food and energy prices—will

 reduce pricing pressures, we see several reasons inflation is likely to remain above the ECB’s 2% target this year. First, last year’s spike in energy prices will lift 2023 goods and services inflation, given the typical lags. Second, euro weakness implies higher costs for imported products. Lastly, the still tight labor market increases the risk that higher wage growth will be sustained long enough to foster persistent services inflation (see Exhibit 99). Against this backdrop, we expect headline and core inflation to rise by 7.0% and 4.2%, respectively, in 2023.  In turn, we see the ECB hiking its policy rate to 3.5% and beginning quantitative tightening through passive runoff of its asset purchase program in the first half of 2023. Although we do not expect policy rates to remain at peak levels for an extended period given that supply disruptions are the main driver of the region’s inflation, we also think rate cuts are unlikely this year absent a significantly deeper recession.  Clearly, the events of last year have revealed vulnerabilities in the Eurozone’s energy supply, which adds tremendous uncertainty to the economic outlook. The energy crisis could even resurface next winter if gas storage is not adequately  
 replenished over the course of the summer and fall. Significant investment is needed to hasten the region’s energy transition, as failure to do so could leave the Eurozone economy permanently below its pre-COVID growth path (see Exhibit 100).  
 United Kingdom: Mind the Gap 
 A cursory glance at the UK’s 4.4% growth last year would imply a booming economy. But the full year result belies a sharp deceleration in activity over the course of 2022 that culminated in a recession starting in the third quarter. While surging energy prices were a key driver of the slowdown, heightened policy uncertainty also had a material impact (see Exhibit 101).

  We expect the downturn to be relatively shallow, with a 1.5% peak-to-trough decline in real GDP and a recovery beginning in the summer. But that recovery is likely to be feeble given the continued squeeze on household budgets from higher energy costs and elevated mortgage interest rates. Similarly, business confidence and fixed investment will remain fragile in the face of higher corporate taxes and tight financial conditions. As a result, we see the economy contracting 1% for the full year.  Unfortunately, it will be difficult for policymakers to lend support. The limits of deficit spending came sharply into focus when the gilt market revolted in reaction to the Liz Truss government’s so-called mini-budget, which proposed large unfunded tax cuts to boost growth. To regain credibility with the financial markets, the Rishi Sunak government was forced to propose a new budget that was the exact opposite of its predecessor, featuring tax increases and spending cuts. In fact, this new plan is set to improve public finances by around 2.5% of GDP by 2027. Although many of these measures are backend- loaded, they nonetheless leave less room for fiscal stimulus in 2023.  Monetary policy is equally constrained considering inflation stands at 40-year highs.  
 Although price pressures are likely to moderate this year, several factors are apt to keep inflation well above the BOE’s 2% inflation target, including sustained wage pressures, the lagged pass-through from higher energy prices and the depreciation of sterling. As a result, the BOE will hike rates further into restrictive territory and continue reducing its balance sheet. We project rates reaching a terminal level of 4.5% in the first half of this year.  More broadly, we think the medium-term economic outlook for the UK has weakened significantly. Aside from the current recession, the economy continues to face important structural challenges arising from Brexit and the need to put public finances on a sustainable path. These issues are not only aggravating the current economic backdrop, but also widening the gap between the UK’s current and pre-COVID growth path. As seen in Exhibit 102, that gap is set to widen from 5.1% to 6.9% of GDP by the end of this year.

 61  Outlook  Investment Strategy Group 
 1.5% last year, well above trend growth of around 0.8%.   The outlook for 2023 is more nuanced. On the one hand, several factors support a further recovery, including households’ considerable excess savings, improved business sentiment, robust profit growth and the reopening of the economy to foreign tourists. On the other hand, new headwinds have arisen. As seen in Exhibit 103, household sentiment has weakened amid declining real disposable incomes. At the same time, rising cost pressures and the weaker global economic outlook cast a cloud over firms’ capital spending plans. Yet despite these challenges, we anticipate the Japanese economy will expand 1.3% this year—its third consecutive year of above- trend growth.  It is tempting to blame this string of stronger economic reports for Japan’s surging headline inflation, which at 3.8% late last year stood near the highest level in three decades. But the rise in inflation has largely been driven by higher energy prices and the sharp depreciation of the yen. Wage pressures, in contrast, have been limited thus far. Given this mix of factors and the forthcoming government subsidies on electricity and gas, we expect both headline and core inflation to moderate this year, reaching 1.8% and 1.9%, respectively.   
  With inflation expected to finish this year below the BOJ’s 2% target, markets were caught off guard by the timing of the bank’s hawkish decision to widen the band around its 10-year JGB target from ±25 bps to ±50 bps. Governor Haruhiko Kuroda had dismissed a wider band on several occasions, while research by BOJ staff found that a wider band could be detrimental to capital spending. Kuroda explained the move as a necessary technical adjustment to the yield curve control (YCC) policy that would improve bond market functioning and the transmission of monetary policy to the real economy. We interpret the move as a small first step toward normalizing the bank’s highly accommodative policy stance. Additional steps in that direction are likely this year, ultimately culminating in the removal of the YCC policy and possible exit from the bank’s negative interest rate policy (NIRP). Several factors will determine the timing of these steps, including the path of inflation, the outcome of the  shunto  wage negotiations in March-April, and the views of the yet-to-be-selected next governor who will succeed Kuroda in April. Even with these potential adjustments, however, the BOJ will remain among the most accommodative large central banks.  
 Emerging Markets: Reversal of Fortune 
 Emerging market economies were hard hit by  last year’s macroeconomic developments. Not  only did Russia’s invasion of Ukraine result in surging food and energy prices, but it also tightened global financial conditions, significantly raising the cost of borrowing for these countries. The resulting slowdown in both domestic consumption and external demand was made worse by multiple COVID lockdowns in China, which further disrupted already fragile supply chains and hampered commodity demand from Chinese importers.

  Although such an abrupt decline in economic activity would typically lead to supportive monetary policy, higher-than-expected inflation and the sharp depreciation of most EM currencies instead forced central banks to hike policy rates aggressively (see Exhibits 104 and 105). Fiscal policy provided some economic relief, but at the  
 cost of further increases in already elevated public debt-to-GDP ratios. In sum, these crosscurrents led to EM GDP growth of 3.3% last year, well below the 4% trend and less than half the 6.8% pace registered in 2021 (see Exhibit 106).  Many of last year’s challenges are likely to persist in 2023. While food and energy prices are not expected to surge again this year, they remain well above pre-pandemic levels and will continue to weigh on household budgets. Lingering inflation also makes rate cuts by global central banks less likely, implying a continuation of tight financial conditions. On the external front, slower growth in major developed market countries will be a headwind to EM exports, while the reopening of China’s economy this year should benefit EMs more broadly. All things considered, we expect 3.7% EM GDP growth in 2023, a modest pickup from last year but still below trend.  
 Asia  Growth prospects in Asia look stronger than in other EM regions, but they hinge on China’s exit from its “zero-COVID” policy. Initially, growth is likely to slow in East Asian countries as the surge in China’s COVID cases dampens economic activity. But by the second quarter, we expect a pickup in exports to China as the initial infection

 wave recedes. The region should also benefit from an influx of Chinese tourists as travel restrictions are lifted. Hong Kong is set to be a prime beneficiary, having been the main destination for Chinese tourists prior to the pandemic.  But even here the outlook is not uniform. Slower growth in the US and Europe, along with a global shift from goods to services, will weigh on the recovery in both Korea and Taiwan. As a result, we expect GDP growth in these countries to slow to around 2% this year from closer to 3% in 2022. In contrast, India is expected to maintain a solid pace of growth at around 5.6%. In fact, India is among several countries in Asia that may benefit from the global relocation of supply chains over time. 
 China  China spent much of last year enduring the deleterious effects of its “zero-COVID” policy, including frequent lockdowns and broad mobility restrictions in response to virus outbreaks. The result was a significant decline in economic activity, made worse by a slump in the property sector and various regulatory crackdowns on private industries. Although the government tried to cushion the blow with more infrastructure spending and rate cuts (see Exhibits 107 and 108), GDP growth nonetheless fell from more than 8% in 2021 to an estimated 2.7% last year. That represents the slowest pace of growth since 1976— outside of the initial pandemic shock in 2020—and  
 one well below both initial consensus expectations of 5.2% and the government’s own growth target of around 5.5%.  China’s decision to begin easing COVID restrictions late last year in response to widespread lockdown protests will have a significant impact on 2023’s growth outlook. As we have seen repeatedly

 in other countries that relaxed COVID controls, there is almost certain to be an initial surge in infections. It took four months for the initial wave in Hong Kong to subside, while Singapore and Taiwan saw multiple smaller waves after the first surge (see Exhibit 109). China’s wave could be even more protracted than those in these countries, as its population has less natural immunity from prior infection and comparatively lower vaccination rates, and its vaccines are considered less effective. At the same time, China’s health- care system is not well prepared to handle the surge in patients. Against this backdrop, we expect economic activity to remain subdued through the first quarter of this year, as people avoid public spaces and factories struggle to find enough healthy workers to run at full capacity.  The economy should start to recover by the second quarter of this year as the virus wave recedes. We expect consumption to drive the rebound on the back of pent-up demand, considerable excess savings (see Exhibit 110) and an improving labor market. Fixed investment should also see a modest lift thanks to the pickup in consumer demand and continued policy support. But these tailwinds will likely be tempered by slower growth abroad, which will weigh on China’s exports and depress capital spending in the manufacturing sector. The property sector also remains an important risk to the outlook, but we believe it will be a smaller drag on GDP than it  
 was last year, particularly given the government’s 16-point support plan announced last November.  Overall, we expect the Chinese economy to expand by 4.9% in 2023. Despite the pickup in growth, inflation pressures should remain muted with headline and core inflation of 2.1% and 1.1%, respectively, both well below the central bank’s tolerance level of 3%. For a more complete examination of our China views, please see our recently published  Insight  on China,  Middle Kingdom: Middle Income .  
 Central and Eastern Europe  Economies in Central and Eastern Europe have been severely impacted by the war in Ukraine, due to both their proximity to the conflict and their economic ties with Russia, especially through energy imports. These effects were visible in the region’s negative trade shock last year following sanctions and embargos on Russian energy, which precipitated surging inflation, widened current account deficits and depleted foreign currency reserves. Responding to these pressures, the regions’ central banks exacerbated the economic malaise by aggressively tightening monetary policy. In the case of Hungary, that amounted to more than a 10-percentage-point increase in the policy rate, while the Czech central bank eroded nearly a quarter of its FX reserves defending the nation’s currency.  Although growth in the region already slowed sharply last year and current account balances are likely to improve in 2023, risks to the economic outlook remain high, especially if a cold winter intensifies gas shortages. Even with fiscal support measures, the region is likely to enter a recession early this year. While this should help bring down inflation, it is likely to remain far enough above central banks’ targets to limit the scope for rate cuts.  Within the region, the outlook for Russia remains skewed to the downside. While its economy shrank by 3.0% last year—a smaller- than-expected decline given the benefit from selling energy at high prices—we expect it to contract by an additional 2.6% in 2023.  
 Latin America  Although Latin American growth was hurt by the broader global slowdown last year, several local drivers also affected activity. For example, the region’s central banks were among the first to tighten monetary policy in response to rising inflation in 2021, leading to a longer period of

population has less natural immunity from prior infection and comparatively lower vaccination rates, and its vaccines are considered less effective.', 'At the same time, Chinas health- care system is

to drive the rebound on the back of pent-up demand, considerable excess savings (see Exhibit 110) and an improving labor market.', 'Fixed investment should also see a modest lift thanks to the pickup in consumer demand and continued policy support.', 'But these tailwinds will likely be tempered by slower growth abroad, which will weigh on Chinas exports and depress capital spending in the manufacturing sector.', 'The property sector also remains an important risk to the outlook, but we believe it will be a smaller drag on GDP than it was last year, particularly given the governments 16-point support plan announced last November.', 'Overall, we expect the Chinese economy to expand by 4.9% in 2023.', 'Despite the pickup in growth, inflation pressures should remain muted with

proximity to the conflict and their economic ties with Russia, especially through energy imports.', 'These effects were visible in the regions negative trade shock last year following sanctions and embargos on Russian energy, which precipitated surging inflation, widened current account deficits and depleted foreign currency reserves.', 'Responding to these pressures, the regions central banks exacerbated the economic malaise by aggressively tightening monetary policy.', 'In the case of Hungary, that amounted to more than a 10-percentage-point increase in the policy rate, while the Czech central bank eroded nearly a quarter of its FX reserves defending the nations currency.', 'Although growth in the region already slowed sharply last year and current account balances are likely to improve in 2023, risks to the economic outlook remain high, especially if a cold winter intensifies gas shortages.', 'Even with fiscal support measures, the region is likely to enter a recession early

 tight financial conditions that has weighed on growth. Commodity price volatility has also had an impact, albeit a less uniform one. In the case of Colombia, Mexico and Brazil, higher oil prices provided a boost to growth, while in the case of Chile, disappointing Chinese copper demand was a significant drag. Growth in the region is likely to remain subdued in 2023, but the end of central bank tightening and China’s reopening may offer some reprieve later in the year.  Within the region, Brazil’s economy grew 3.1% last year, led by a strong recovery in the services sector. Fiscal spending in the run-up to the presidential election and strong commodity prices also helped. But with its central bank having now taken real policy rates deeply into restrictive territory at nearly 8%, we expect economic growth to slow to just 0.9% this year. While the further fiscal support proposed by the new administration poses upside risk to this forecast, it would also delay much-needed debt reduction and therefore result in higher borrowing costs.

 on the road to recovery from the global pandemic, financial markets hit an icy patch last year. The S&P 500 slid 18%, its largest annual decline since 2008. The wreckage was not limited to US stocks. At the worst of the downdraft last October, 85% of the primary equity indices tracked by Bloomberg showed a loss for the year. 47  Collectively, those declines amounted to nearly $32 trillion in market value at the time. 48  Even bonds—which typically act as a defensive portfolio asset—were not spared, with the Bloomberg Global Aggregate Bond Index slipping 16%. This unusual decline in both stocks and bonds, which has occurred less than 2% of the time since 1926, 49  resulted in the fourth-worst loss for a balanced portfolio on record.

  To be sure, many of the key uncertainties from last year remain, including elevated inflation, ongoing geopolitical tensions, and the murky trajectory of the Chinese economy. The risk of a US recession is also top of mind, especially with central banks continuing to hike policy rates and many recession indicators already flashing red. These are legitimate concerns, and we accordingly give a US recession this year even odds.  But we also should not lose sight of the fact that markets are forward-looking, meaning they typically fall in anticipation of bad news but begin recovering even as the headlines of the day remain ominous. This has two important implications for 2023. First, risk assets are likely to deliver attractive returns if a US recession is avoided, given the extent of last year’s losses. Second, even in the event of a mild US recession that ends this year, stocks could still deliver positive returns, considering the sizable rallies seen in the final months of past economic downturns. Since not all paths in a recession lead to stock market losses at the end of 2023, we believe the odds of positive US equity returns exceed those of a recession this year. This also explains why we expect gains in Eurozone and UK equities even though we believe these regions are already in recession (see Exhibit 111).  Our base case implies financial markets can regain traction in 2023. In equities, we see more paths to gains than losses by year-end. Bonds are also expected to rise, as today’s higher yields provide an ample cushion to absorb any further increase in interest rates. But there will no doubt be curves along the road ahead.  
 US Equities: Down but Not Out   
 Few investors will lament the passing of 2022. US equities lost nearly $13 trillion in market capitalization last year, roughly equivalent to the combined GDP of Japan, Germany and the UK. Last year’s rout was also the second equity bear market in the last three years. But unlike 2020, there was no speedy recovery last year. Instead, US equities spent nearly the entirety of the year mired in a double-digit drawdown that ranked among the most persistent downtrends in history (see Exhibit 112).  The decline in stocks is understandable considering the bounty of concerns today. Recession is chief among these, as investors worry that the

 combination of tighter monetary policy and below- trend growth necessary to bring down inflation will also tip the US economy into contraction. That fear is reinforced by the cautionary signals emanating from a host of leading indicators, such as widespread yield curve inversions and the abrupt downturn in the housing market. There is also an unusual consensus among economists that a recession is likely (see Exhibit 113).  Given this backdrop, our expectation for positive equity returns in 2023 may seem counterintuitive (see Exhibit 114). After all, how can we assign a combined 70% probability to favorable equity outcomes while also placing even odds to a recession this year? To understand, it is helpful to look at both the soft landing and hard landing scenarios.  If recession is avoided, we expect mid-single- digit nominal GDP growth to lift earnings by 4–6% this year, providing support for higher equity prices. Exhibit 115 shows that earnings tend to track nominal GDP growth closely over time, as corporations are paid in nominal dollars. As a result, it is very rare for earnings to decline when the economy is still expanding—a fact that repeatedly confounded bearish calls for a collapse in earnings last year.  
  Our expectations for a slower pace of US dollar appreciation in 2023 could also help ease some of last year’s pressure on corporate revenues. At the same time, we do not consider rising interest expense a key concern this year, as more than

 90% of S&P 500 firms’ debt is fixed, its average duration is long (at about 12 years) and only 7% of it matures this year. 50  Interest expense must also be netted against the interest income now being earned on nearly $2 trillion of cash on corporate balance sheets.  We also draw comfort from the strong historical correlation between sales growth and profit margins. Past periods with positive sales growth—which we also expect this year—saw margins remain flat or expand about two-thirds of the time, even during  
 the inflationary 1970s (see Exhibit 116). Moreover, the significant improvement in global supply chains in recent quarters should help ease the pressure on profit margins this year (see Exhibit 117). Consistent with this analysis, our base case assumes relatively flat margins.  If the economy instead enters a recession, earnings will likely decline from their 2022 level. But whether that results in lower or higher stock prices at the end of 2023 depends critically on when the recession ends. As a rule, the market has more time to recover the earlier in the year a recession occurs.  Two factors explain this dynamic. First, stocks are forward-looking, meaning they typically fall in anticipation of a deteriorating economic environment but begin recovering even as earnings are still being downgraded. During past bear markets, equities have typically troughed six to nine months before earnings reach their low (see Exhibit 118). Equities have also typically bottomed about three months before the end of recessions. Put simply, markets bottom when the news is still bad.  Second, the recovery from past recessionary lows has been rapid, with the S&P 500 rallying about 20% over the span of a few months (see Exhibit 119). The combination of these two factors suggests that even a recession ending late this year would still be consistent with our base case S&P

 500 target (see Exhibit 120). Because not all paths in a recession lead to lower equity prices at the end of this year, we believe the odds of positive equity returns exceed those of a recession in 2023.  Other factors also support this conclusion. Once the market has fallen into bear-market territory—which happened last year around 3800 on the S&P 500—the median equity gain in the following year was 23% (see Exhibit 121). Similarly, history suggests 83% odds of a gain in 2023 given the rarity of two consecutive down years for the S&P 500. This year is also the third in the presidential cycle, which has historically had the highest returns of the four-year cycle and 84% odds of a gain (see Exhibit 122).  It is also worth mentioning that past years that saw a similarly large decline in the S&P 500 P/E ratio have typically been followed by strong equity returns (see Exhibit 123). While some have attributed last year’s P/E de-rating to higher real interest rates alone, we think it also reflects genuine recessionary concerns. That connection is apparent in Exhibit 124, which shows that real interest rates and Bloomberg stories about recession rose in tandem last year in response to the Federal Reserve’s  
 aggressive rate hiking cycle. In fact, 2022 featured as many Bloomberg stories on recession as 2020, a year when the US economy was actually in recession.

  To be clear, we are not arguing that today’s valuations fully discount a recession. But considering last year’s 25% peak-to-trough equity drawdown—which would be the largest in advance of a recession in history (see Exhibit 125)—we do  
 think a significant part of any valuation reset has already occurred. Current US equity valuations also seem reasonable compared to past periods with similar interest rates (see Exhibits 126 and 127).

 that the market would be completely surprised by a recession at this point, which could temper the resulting downdraft. As seen in Exhibit 129, this is arguably the most widely anticipated recession in history and has already been preceded by one of the longest streaks of bearish investor sentiment on record (see Exhibit 130).  Given the uncertainties above, investors should first ensure that their strategic asset allocation accurately reflects their risk tolerance. But provided that is the case, history suggests investors are better off staying the course and even looking for opportunities to overweight stocks if they weaken further, given the positive skew between upside and downside risks from current levels. 
 Non-US Developed Market Equities: A Rocky Road to Recovery 
 The relative performance of non-US developed equities was a bright spot last year. As seen in Exhibit 131, the 7% decline in the MSCI EAFE (Europe, Australasia, and the Far East) index in local currency terms significantly outperformed the declines seen in both US and emerging market stocks, which were closer to 20%. Some developed equity markets, such as the UK and Australia, even finished 2022 with gains.  
  Although we expect more uniformly positive equity returns across EAFE countries in 2023, the path is unlikely to be smooth. This year likely begins with recessions in two of the largest developed equity markets outside the US, the Eurozone and the UK, which together represent around half of EAFE market capitalization. At the same time, ongoing geopolitical uncertainty in many countries likely sets a practical limit on how much of last year’s equity decline can be recouped.  Despite these headwinds, we think forward- looking investors will push valuation multiples higher this year as they anticipate an eventual recovery in earnings. For EAFE, that implies a low-double-digit total return in local currency terms. We also forecast positive gains for European markets this year, but we expect only the UK to recapture its previous peak.  
 Eurozone Equities: Continued Resilience  
 Eurozone equities bested their global peers last year (see Exhibit 131), a notable departure from their tendency to lag in down markets. This surprising outcome was rooted in a more than 20% increase in earnings, which reached their highest level in more than a decade. Considering the Eurozone’s proximity to Ukraine and its

 75  Outlook  Investment Strategy Group 
 reliance on Russian energy, the resilience of its companies last year was remarkable.  This resilience is likely to give way to lower earnings in 2023, as Europe begins the year in a recession amid a global growth slowdown. Even so, we expect investors to push P/E ratios higher as the region emerges from a short-lived and relatively shallow economic downturn this year, just as they have during prior recessions (see Exhibit 132). That view is supported by the area’s relatively attractive valuations. At just 11.3x, the Eurozone’s P/E ratio stands in the bottom 30% of the post-GFC distribution and below its pre- pandemic value. The net result of falling earnings amid rising valuations should be a low-double- digit total return for Eurozone equities this year; many elements of our forecast are the mirror image of their values last year (see Exhibit 133).  As discussed in Section I, we remain overweight the Eurozone banks. Not only did the sector outperform broader Eurozone equities once again last year, but it also generated a positive return despite a global bear market. Several factors underpin this resilience. First, the ongoing increase in global interest rates directly benefits the banks’ net interest income. Second, the banks have spent the last decade improving their balance sheets, resulting in higher capital ratios and fewer  
 losses in their loan books. Finally, the sector is attractively valued, particularly relative to what investors have historically paid for the level of profitability it currently has. Against this backdrop, we continue to recommend an overweight to Eurozone banks given their improving profitability, scope for higher valuations and attractive 6% dividend yield.  
 UK Equities: Still Playing Catchup 
 The gain in UK equities last year in local currency terms stood in sharp contrast to the significant losses seen in almost all other major equity markets. Last year was also the first time since 2016 that UK equities had outpaced the MSCI World Index. This outperformance can be traced to a few factors, including the FTSE 100’s high concentration of value stocks and commodity-

 exposed stocks, its record-low relative valuations at the start of 2022 and the depreciation of the currency. Yet despite last year’s strength, UK equities have still not closed the performance gap that emerged relative to other global equities after the start of the pandemic (see Exhibit 134).  That gap is likely to extend into 2023, as UK earnings decline in response to a domestic recession and slowing global growth, as well as a waning tailwind from commodity prices and past sterling depreciation. But as was the case in the Eurozone, we expect investors’ willingness to pay higher valuations as the UK economy exits its recession to fully offset the decline in profits this year (see Exhibit 135).  
  The combination of declining profits and a modestly higher P/E ratio—along with the FTSE 100’s 3.9% dividend yield—supports a low-double- digit total return in our base case (see Exhibit 111). The currently depressed levels of investor sentiment also imply similar total returns to our baseline forecast in 2023, as this has been a contrarian indicator of future equity returns in the past.  
 Japanese Equities: Encore Unlikely 
 Japan also outperformed global equities last year. Three main factors drove this achievement. First, Japan’s overseas earnings benefited from the limited rise in the country’s interest rates and the sharp depreciation in its currency, both the result of the BOJ’s unwillingness to follow other central banks in tightening policy. Second, the Japanese economy was able to sustain above-trend growth. Lastly, the underweight position of foreign investors at the start of last year left little for them to sell (see Exhibit 136). Because these investors are typically the marginal buyers or sellers of Japanese equities, their underweight positioning indirectly supported the stocks.  We forecast a low-double-digit total return for Japan in 2023 (see Exhibit

 111). As with our views on other EAFE markets, we expect higher valuations to be the key driver of equity prices this year, offsetting flat earnings growth. But we expect a smaller rise in Japan’s P/E ratio than in other markets, as the BOJ seems poised to tighten monetary policy just as other central banks reach the end of their hiking cycles. In fact, a more rapid or forceful tightening of monetary policy represents a key downside risk to our forecast. Given this balance of risks, an encore of last year’s outperformance is unlikely. 
 Emerging Market Equities:  Fading Headwinds from the North  
 Emerging market equities had another challenging year in 2022. Their 20% decline capped the sixth year of losses—and eighth year of underperformance relative to the S&P 500—in the last decade. While 16 of the 24 countries in the MSCI EM Index had negative returns in 2022, North Asia was the largest headwind to the index’s performance (see Exhibit 137). Indeed, China, Korea and Taiwan—which together account for 58% of MSCI EM market capitalization— collectively lost 25% last year, more than twice the 11% decline for the rest of the index.  We expect calmer winds from North Asia in 2023. Not only will conditions look more favorable with China’s reopening, but the region should  
 also benefit from abating declines in chip prices, less regulatory pressure on China’s internet sector and less of a drag on profit margins from spiraling commodities prices. As a result, we expect MSCI EM forward earnings to rise by 10% in 2023, to $90 per share. At the same time, valuation multiples should decline modestly to 11.4x, as slightly lower interest rates are offset by a moderate increase in the equity risk premium. Combined with EM equities’ 3% dividend yield, these elements imply a high- single-digit total return in 2023 (see Exhibit 111).  Despite these projected equity gains, we still see four dark clouds on the horizon. First, the outlook for China remains foggy given its rising economic, social and geopolitical risks, discussed in greater detail in our December 2022  Insight  report,  Middle Kingdom: Middle Income . Second, slower global growth will weigh heavily on export-dependent North Asia. Third, outflows from global investors could gain speed due to EM equities’ continued underperformance. Finally, tightening in monetary policy last year—which saw the median policy rate among the 17 countries in the MSCI EM Index with inflation-targeting central banks increase from 3% to 7% 51  after 101 collective rate hikes—was dramatic, and its ultimate impact remains highly uncertain.  Although the gale-force headwinds of last year are likely to subside, we still expect some gusts ahead. For this reason, we continue to recommend a tactically neutral allocation to EM equities.

 2023 Global Currency Outlook 
 The US dollar enjoyed a banner year in 2022, posting its second consecutive year of broad gains and surpassing every other developed market currency, as well as all but a handful of those in emerging markets (see Exhibit 138). Several factors underpinned this outperformance, including the most aggressive Federal Reserve hiking cycle in decades, along with a global energy shock and flagging risk sentiment that prompted investors to turn to the dollar as a safe haven.  The yen endured the worst of the US dollar’s strength and stood out as the worst-performing currency among developed market peers after the Swedish krona. Surging import prices and an exceptionally accommodative Bank of Japan sent the yen 12% lower versus the dollar. The British pound also suffered a double-digit downdraft against the backdrop of a mini-budget crisis and resignation of two prime ministers. Its 11% decline was the pound’s worst annual showing since 2016, when the UK voted to leave the European Union.  EM currency performance was slightly less uniform. While most Asian and European currencies fell against the greenback, several Latin American currencies—including the Mexican peso, Brazilian real and Peruvian sol—posted moderate gains.  We expect the interplay of global growth and central bank policy to remain a critical driver of the US dollar’s path. With real interest rate differentials  
 between the US and its developed market peers still wide against an uncertain global backdrop, our forecast calls for the US dollar to rise in 2023. But compared with last year, we expect a smaller low-single-digit pace of appreciation and more dispersion in the US dollar’s relative performance.  Regardless of our tactical views, we continue to recommend that clients fully hedge their offshore fixed income. We also recommend that US and non-US clients hedge 50% and 70%, respectively, of their non-local developed market equity holdings to reduce portfolio volatility and provide diversification.  
 US Dollar  It is hard to find fault with the US dollar’s performance over the past decade. Not only has the greenback posted eight winning years over this period, but it has also advanced 46% since the lows of the financial crisis, including an 8% gain in 2022 alone. The dollar’s outperformance against every other developed market currency last year was yet another reminder of its hegemony.  Although the dollar index recently traded at its highest level in 20 years, we think several factors continue to support dollar outperformance. For one, US growth is likely to outpace that in most other major developed markets this year, supporting the positive policy rate differential with developed market peers (see Exhibit 139). In turn, these policy and growth differentials should entice foreign investors to favor US-dollar assets at the  
 Exhibit 138: 2022 Currency Performance (vs. US Dollar)  Most major currencies depreciated against the US dollar last year.

 expense of lower-yielding alternatives, providing a tailwind to the greenback. Moreover, the end of a Federal Reserve hiking cycle—such as is expected this year—has typically seen the dollar rise over the following six months (see Exhibit 140). Finally, noncommercial investors begin the year with light US dollar positioning, providing scope for them to increase exposure.  That said, there are downside risks as well. The dollar’s valuation now stands well above its long-term average, making the greenback more vulnerable (see Exhibit 141). Such disappointments could come from abroad—such as materially stronger foreign growth or tighter monetary policy outside the US—or domestically, if the Federal Reserve is forced to abruptly cut rates. While it is not our base case, a convergence in global monetary policy would potentially erode the yield advantage of US assets and thereby weigh on the dollar.  Although we still think this balance of risks favors a stronger dollar, that appreciation is likely to be more modest and more diffuse against other global currencies than was the case last year. 
 Euro  For the second consecutive year, the euro was a casualty of the US dollar’s strength. In fact, the  
 euro was down 16% at its worst point before recovering to a still sizable 6% loss for 2022. Although softer economic growth and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine were key drivers, last year’s weakness continued a string of losses—in seven of the last nine years—that began when the ECB

 announced plans to cut its deposit rate to below zero for the first time in history.  With the euro now nearly 25% below its 2014 peak, it may appear undervalued relative to its history. But this discount may be warranted given the many fault lines running through the Eurozone, not the least of which is the region’s lack of energy security. Structurally higher gas prices resulting from a lack of low-cost alternatives to Russian energy make the continent’s energy-intensive industrial sector less competitive, potentially justifying a lower exchange rate relative to history. The Eurozone’s capital flow profile represents another source of vulnerability for the euro. Demand for euro-denominated assets has plunged, falling even below levels seen in the sovereign debt crisis. Moreover, both the current account and net foreign direct investment are in deficit for the first time in a decade (see Exhibit 142).  Even so, there are several factors that could potentially limit the extent of any further euro weakness. First, there is a low hurdle for euro- friendly surprises given that most investors already expect a mild recession in the region. Second, the euro could benefit from both stronger economic activity and a stronger narrow basic balance if a warmer winter ends up limiting the need for energy rationing and dampening energy prices. Finally, the yield advantage of euro-denominated assets could improve relative to other developed markets— 
 thereby supporting the euro—if the ECB needs to tighten monetary policy more than expected given historically high inflation.  We give a slight edge to the negative factors discussed and expect low-single-digit losses for the euro relative to the dollar. 
 Yen  Yen investors are forgiven for feeling whiplashed last year. After depreciating close to 25% against the US dollar by October—reaching its weakest relative level in more than three decades—the yen surprised traders with a powerful 15% rally into year-end. Despite these wild gyrations, the yen’s 12% loss in 2022 still ranked as its worst since 2013 and left it among the worst-performing developed market currencies for the second consecutive year.  With the yen having now lost nearly a quarter of its value since the onset of the pandemic, there is certainly scope for last year’s depreciation to reverse. Core Japanese inflation is running at its highest level in a decade and above the Bank of Japan’s 2% target. The BOJ is unlikely to duplicate the degree of monetary policy tightening seen by other major central banks, not least because inflation is expected to fall to near 2% this year. But with new BOJ leadership appointments later this year, the odds are rising that it will soon articulate an endpoint to its near-zero interest rate

 policy. Such a development would help narrow Japan’s cross-border interest rate differential and reduce a recent source of yen weakness.  Also consider that the yen has historically performed well during economic slowdowns. While a US recession is not our base case, the possibility has risen markedly over the past year. Any additional global growth headwinds that boost risk aversion could lead investors into the yen as a liquid hedge, as we saw after the onset of previous recessions (see Exhibit 143).  Of course, the yen also still faces several obstacles. Japan’s current account surplus has halved over the last year given higher import prices. In turn, the trade balance shows its largest deficit ever (see Exhibit 144). This implies marginally less structural demand for the yen and may limit its ability to recover to pre-pandemic levels. Japanese corporations are also likely to generate sustained pressure on the currency, as they continue to sell yen to invest in foreign ventures with better long-term growth prospects and higher yields. Although these outflows slowed during the initial stages of the pandemic, they have quickened more recently and now stand at about 3.5% of GDP, a historically large share.  Taking these factors together, we see scope for a mid-single-digit rise in the yen, with the possibility of both long and short tactical trading opportunities throughout 2023.  
 Pound  Along with most other currencies in 2022, the pound fell in relation to the US dollar—its second consecutive year of underperformance. Last year’s 11% loss masked a more dramatic 25% peak- to-trough drawdown in the currency through September following a budget crisis and the resignation of two prime ministers. This continued the currency’s volatile return profile, which dates back to 2016 and the United Kingdom’s decision to leave the European Union.  We expect further weakness in the pound in 2023. The UK economy is forecast to contract this year, which may limit how much further the Bank of England can tighten and opens the door for rate cuts in late 2023 or 2024. A less favorable absolute policy rate differential with the US could also diminish the appeal of the pound to yield- seeking investors. Moreover, the UK’s position as a net energy importer has pushed its current account deficit to 4.2% of GDP (see Exhibit 145). This too will be a drag on the pound unless the energy shock recedes rapidly.  Still, the risks to the pound are not completely to the downside. Any combination of better global growth or optimism for a faster-than-expected UK economic recovery could generate foreign demand for UK assets, which would benefit the pound. There is certainly scope for better foreign direct investment, which currently stands near its weakest level since the GFC (see Exhibit 145). In addition,

 the political turbulence that has undermined the pound may recede in 2023 for a few reasons, including last year’s fiscal policy U-turn and the lack of any major election or referendum votes this year.  On balance, we expect the pound to depreciate by modest single digits versus the US dollar this year. 
 Emerging Market Currencies  EM currencies disappointed again last year. Their 6.1% decline against the US dollar marked the ninth annual loss for the asset class in the past decade. 52  Over this same period, the asset class has cumulatively lost half its nominal value against the US dollar.  While many factors have contributed to this underwhelming decade, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine was one of the key drivers of these currencies’ weakness last year. Surging commodity prices in the wake of the invasion fueled inflation across EM, pushing real interest rates into negative territory despite an early start to the hiking cycle by most EM central banks. Higher energy prices were particularly hard on European emerging market currencies, which depreciated 10−25% into last fall.  The hostilities were also accompanied by a fast-paced hiking cycle in the US and a broad- based selloff in risk assets, leading to tighter global financial conditions that weighed on EM  
 currencies. In Asia, China’s “zero-COVID” policy, its multiple lockdowns, and the renminbi’s 15% peak-to-trough decline led the rest of that bloc into weakness. The one bright spot was Latin America, as the currencies of Mexico and Brazil ended the year with positive real rates that boosted the credibility of their central banks and offered investors attractive incremental yields (see Exhibit 146).  The outlook for 2023 is mixed. On the one hand, EM currencies should benefit if the Federal Reserve signals an end to its hiking cycle, as interest rate differentials favor these currencies. On the other hand, investors will want volatility to subside before overweighting EM currencies (see Exhibit 147). But that stability may prove elusive given looming risks, such as a US recession.  In this environment, we expect investors to become more selective and favor higher yielding currencies with improving macro fundamentals. The Chinese renminbi does not cleanly match either of these criteria, and we see two key reasons it could weaken this year. First, Chinese bonds offer less attractive yields, which stand two percentage points below US Treasuries. Second, the end of “zero-COVID” is likely to put pressure on China’s current account as its service deficit widens. At a time when other countries’ current accounts are set to improve, this will also weigh on the renminbi.

 Global Fixed Income Outlook  
 Most bond investors will be glad to turn the page on 2022. A combination of aggressive interest rate hikes by global central banks and historically low bond yields at the start of the year resulted in deep losses for fixed income portfolios last year. The Bloomberg Global Aggregate Bond Index fell 16%, a decline three times larger than the previous worst reading since the benchmark’s inception in 1990. While credit fared better than duration—with spreads supported by robust nominal growth—all fixed income categories suffered losses last year (see Exhibit 148).  Fortunately for bondholders, an encore is unlikely for several reasons. The higher starting level of today’s yields provides bond investors with a buffer to absorb any further increases in interest rates. Moreover, the upward pressure on rates from central bank hikes should ease given our expectation that the Federal Reserve will conclude its tightening cycle in the first half of 2023, and that the ECB and BOE will do the same shortly thereafter. Lastly, our forecast of below- trend growth implies easing inflationary pressures and higher risk of recession, both of which increase the odds of  
 eventual Federal Reserve rate cuts. Against this backdrop, we expect lower 10-year yields across most advanced and emerging economies this year.  Of course, our constructive view on bonds does not imply the absence of risks. Across the US, Eurozone and United Kingdom, private markets will need to absorb a record $3 trillion in estimated net bond supply this year (see Exhibit 149), composed of around $2 trillion in net new sovereign debt and $1 trillion fewer bond purchases by central banks (i.e., quantitative tightening). With central banks withdrawing the largest source of demand in recent years, there is risk that private investors will require higher risk premiums to accommodate the elevated funding needs of advanced economies.

 uncertainty around the path of inflation could also weigh on bond demand.  Still, we think the balance of risks supports positive total returns for intermediate fixed income in our base case (see Exhibit 150). While cash offers attractive returns, unexpected rate cuts by the Federal Reserve in response to a growth shock could quickly erode its yield. In contrast, high- quality fixed income is the only asset that has effectively hedged against past deflationary shocks.  In the sections that follow, we will review the specifics of each major fixed income market. 
 US Treasuries  Our 2022  Outlook  featured the most negative expected returns for US Treasuries that we have ever published. Yet the actual losses last year  
 exceeded even our pessimistic forecasts. In the case of the 10-year Treasury, investors were left with a historic 16% loss after its yield registered the largest increase in a calendar year on record.  The prospects for 10-year Treasuries are brighter now, with the midpoint of our year-end 3.15–3.65% yield target range implying positive high-single-digit returns in 2023. We expect the Federal Reserve to conclude its hiking cycle before the middle of the year, as its focus shifts from curtailing inflation to avoiding a hard landing of the economy. The combination of still-restrictive policy rates and the market’s expectation of eventual rate cuts in response to slowing growth is likely to keep the yield curve inverted.  Investors are focused on when policy rates and bond yields will peak. While history is not a perfect guide, it does show that in nearly every hiking cycle over the last 40 years, the 10-year Treasury yield reached its high before or around the time when policy rates peaked. Only twice—in May 1974 and December 1980—did the 10-year yield peak after the policy rate did. Both exceptions occurred in a decade of “stop-go” monetary policy shifts that ultimately allowed inflation expectations to become unanchored.  Yet in contrast with that period, market-based inflation expectations now remain well anchored following the fastest hiking cycle in decades. History suggests that 10-year yields could peak before or around the second quarter of this year as the Federal Reserve concludes its hiking cycle. In fact, yields may have already peaked last year.  Prior peaks in the policy rate have been followed by large declines in 10-year yields over the subsequent year, ranging from 80 basis points to 330 basis points. The 3.4% midpoint of our forecast range implies a more gradual decline in yields than is suggested by history, but we anticipate this slower decline for three reasons. First, positive economic growth in our base case should support yields. Second, we expect inflation to moderate but remain above the Federal Reserve’s target this year. Finally, the bond market will have to absorb around $2 trillion of net Treasury supply this year—up from $1.6 trillion in 2022—as US funding needs remain elevated at a time when the Federal Reserve is winding down its balance sheet. 53

 Treasuries are sufficiently compelling given similar returns from cash and lingering inflation uncertainty. We believe so, since unexpected rate cuts by the Federal Reserve in response to a growth shock could quickly erode the yield on cash. At the same time, such a scenario could see 10-year Treasuries deliver double-digit total returns, roughly four times larger than those of cash (see Exhibit 151). As we often highlight, Treasuries are the only asset class that has effectively hedged against deflationary shocks in the past.  
 Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS)  After the fastest Federal Reserve hiking cycle in four decades, market-based inflation expectations fell sharply from their highs last year and remain well anchored near the bank’s 2% inflation target (see Exhibit 152). Rising nominal interest rates coupled with lower inflation expectations drove 10-year real rates higher by a staggering 268 basis points. The resulting 12% loss in TIPS last year underperformed similar-duration nominal bonds despite the sharpest increase in inflation since the 1980s.  We think the outlook for TIPS is brighter in 2023. With 10-year breakeven inflation rates already near the Federal Reserve’s 2% inflation target, the scope for further declines is more  
 limited. Moreover, TIPS should benefit from some retracement in real rates after last year’s surge, as we expect stable inflation breakeven rates and declining nominal 10-year Treasury yields.  Still, TIPS investors face several familiar headwinds. For one, TIPS lack the hedging qualities of traditional bonds since breakeven inflation rates tend to fall during cyclical downturns. TIPS are also less liquid than nominal Treasuries and hence an inferior source of liquidity during market turbulence. 54  Additionally, TIPS are not tax efficient for taxable clients. For all these reasons, we continue to advise US clients with taxable accounts to use municipal bonds for their strategic allocation. 
 US Municipal Bonds  There was little to celebrate for municipal bond investors last year. The Bloomberg Municipal Bond Index fell 8.5%, its worst decline since 1982. Similarly, the 4.8% loss in the shorter duration 1- to 10-year municipal bond index was its worst performance since the inception of the index in 1993. Municipal high yield bonds were not spared either, losing 13.1% for the year (see Exhibit 153).  Several factors contributed to this poor performance. Chief among these was the nearly

uncertainty.', 'We believe so, since unexpected rate cuts by the Federal Reserve in response to a growth shock could quickly erode the yield on cash.', 'At the same time, such a scenario could see 10-year Treasuries deliver double-digit total returns, roughly four times larger than those of cash (see Exhibit 151).', 'As we often highlight, Treasuries are the only asset class that has effectively hedged against deflationary shocks in the past.', 'Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) After the fastest Federal Reserve hiking cycle in four decades, market-based inflation expectations fell sharply from their highs last year and remain well anchored near the banks 2% inflation target (see Exhibit 152).', 'Rising nominal interest rates coupled with lower inflation expectations drove 10-year real rates higher by a staggering 268 basis points.', 'The resulting 12% loss in TIPS last year underperformed similar-duration nominal bonds despite the sharpest increase in inflation since the 1980s.', 'We think the outlook for TIPS is brighter in 2023.', 'With 10-year breakeven inflation rates already near the Federal Reserves 2% inflation target, the scope for further declines is more limited.', 'Moreover, TIPS should benefit from some retracement in real rates after last years surge, as we expect stable inflation breakeven rates and declining nominal 10-year Treasury yields.', 'Still, TIPS investors face several familiar headwinds.', 'For one, TIPS lack the hedging qualities of traditional bonds since breakeven inflation rates tend to fall during cyclical downturns.', 'TIPS are also less liquid than nominal Treasuries and hence an inferior source of liquidity during market turbulence.', '54 Additionally, TIPS are not tax efficient for taxable clients.', 'For all these reasons, we continue to advise US clients with taxable accounts to use municipal bonds for their strategic allocation.', 'US Municipal Bonds There was little to celebrate for municipal bond investors last year.', 'The Bloomberg Municipal Bond Index fell 8.5%, its worst decline since 1982.', 'Similarly, the 4.8% loss in the shorter duration 1- to 10-year municipal bond index was its worst performance since the inception of the index in 1993.', 'Municipal high yield bonds were not spared either, losing 13.1% for the year (see Exhibit 153).', 'Several factors

 250 basis point increase in the yield on the broader municipal bond index last year. This drag was made worse by the historically low level of municipal bond yields and spreads at the start of 2022, which provided little buffer to absorb higher rates. The largest exodus from the asset class since 1984 was also a material headwind to performance. As seen in Exhibit 154, municipal  
 bonds registered $118 billion of outflows from mutual funds and ETFs in 2022, around twice the amount seen during the 2013 “taper tantrum.”  Last year’s poor performance stands in contrast to municipal fundamentals, which remain healthy. General fund revenue for states grew 14.5% year- over-year to $1.17 trillion in fiscal 2022, following a 16.6% increase in fiscal 2021. Although spending rose by 18.3% year-over-year in response to a variety of factors, including higher inflation and lingering pandemic costs, no state made a budget cut due to a revenue shortfall last year. As shown in Exhibit 155, the states’ general fund rainy day balances grew to an all-time high of $134.5 billion in 2022, with the median balance as a share of annual spending also reaching an all-time high of 11.6%. 55   Looking ahead, we expect mid-single-digit nominal consumption growth in 2023 to underpin healthy sales tax collections. Moreover, our expectation for only a modest rise in the unemployment rate to 4.1% implies that personal income tax revenues should remain resilient. The same could be said for property taxes, an area in which it will take a few years for recent housing weakness to have an impact.  Consistent with the above, broad credit trends remain positive. Consider that credit agency upgrades outpaced downgrades by 4.2 times for tax-backed issuers and by 2.7 times for revenue- backed issuers (see Exhibit 156). Based on dollars of bond par value, upgrades outpaced downgrades

 by a factor of nearly 10 last year, with $327 billion of upgrades but just $34 billion of downgrades (see Exhibit 157).  While municipal issuer fundamentals are sound, valuations in the sector are less appealing. As seen in Exhibit 158, the ratio of municipal yields to Treasury yields remains below its long- term average despite last year’s selloff. Similarly,  
 the incremental after-tax yield investors earn for owning municipal bonds instead of matched- duration Treasuries also stands well below average for both 5-year and 10-year maturities (see Exhibit 159). The same is true for spreads on the Muni 1-10 index (see Exhibit 160).  Against this backdrop, we expect US municipal bonds to generate a low-single-digit gain this year

 headline return, however, with sectors such as utilities, transportation and airlines outperforming housing, tobacco and hospitals.  Like broader municipal bonds, the high yield subsector features resilient fundamentals that are reflected in tighter than normal spreads. As seen in Exhibit 161, the 195 basis points of incremental yield these bonds offer relative to 10-year Treasuries is 60 basis points lower than the long-run average spread. This difference is explained by solid credit fundamentals; last year’s defaults were 41% lower than in 2021 (see Exhibit 162). Moreover, only 1.4% of these bonds trade at distressed spreads, well below the 7.9% average since 2008 (see Exhibit 163).  With spreads already tight relative to history and with economic growth slowing, we expect wider spreads to erode part of the benefit of lower Treasury yields and the sector’s current 5.9% yield. The result would be positive mid-single-digit returns in 2023, which in our view argues for clients staying invested at their customized strategic weight.  
 US Corporate High Yield Credit  Last year was a tumultuous one for corporate credit. The 15.8% decline in investment grade bonds was the worst since 1973, while the 11.2% loss in corporate high yield was its second-worst since 1983 (see Exhibits 164 and 165). Although bank loans declined as well, their modest 1.14%  
 loss was a relative bright spot (see Exhibit 153 in the US Municipal Bond section).  The bulk of these losses came from sharply higher interest rates rather than credit. In fact, the trailing high yield default rate, including distressed exchanges, stood at just 1.6% at the end of November last year, about half of its long-run average. In turn, high yield bond spreads—which represent investors’ compensation for taking

 default risk—rose 186 basis points during 2022 but remain well below average (see Exhibit 166). The result was that only 3.7% of high yield’s total 11.2% loss was attributable to wider spreads and actual default losses. Similarly, the corporate high yield credit default swap index—which reflects just the default risk of the underlying bonds—suffered a loss of less than 1% last year (see Exhibit 153 in the US Municipal Bond section).  
  Healthy corporate fundamentals help explain why high yield bond spreads have remained so well-behaved. As seen in Exhibit 167, median leverage among high yield issuers has been lower only 11% of the time since 1999. At the same time, the earnings of the median issuer are four times larger than their interest expense, close to the highest coverage ratios on record. These figures are equally sturdy for leveraged loan borrowers (see Exhibit 168).  The underlying credit quality of the high yield universe has also improved, with BB-rated bonds representing nearly half the index today compared to about a third of it historically. Similarly, the share of bonds rated CCC and lower—which are at higher risk of default—stands below its historical average. Issuance by these lower-rated companies is also still low relative to history (see Exhibit 169). The same could be said for the share of LBO and M&A-related issuance, which is below its pre-GFC average. Consistent with this backdrop, credit rating agency upgrades of high yield bonds outpaced downgrades by 1.8 times last year based on dollar par value, and recovery rates on defaulted securities were well above average.  Whether fundamentals remain resilient in the face of slower economic growth this year is a critical question facing investors. To be sure, several factors point to higher default risk, including tightening lending standards for commercial and industrial loans, a rising share of securities trading

  Still, rising defaults should not be equated to soaring ones. The default rate ended last year in the bottom 15% of its historical distribution, making some increase in 2023 very likely. In addition, the risk of refinancing-related defaults is low in the next two years, with less than 10% of the securities in the high yield market maturing (see Exhibit 173). Higher interest rates are also likely to continue constraining high yield bond issuance after it decreased by more than 60% last year.   Against this backdrop, our model implies a 3% par-weighted default rate for high yield bonds this year, roughly in line with their long-term average (see Exhibit 174). The rate is a slightly higher 3.5% for leveraged loans, given the idiosyncratic factors discussed earlier. With default rates normalizing higher, we expect high yield spreads will widen to around 550 basis points. Such a spread would be sufficient to offer investors an incremental risk premium above expected default losses consistent with the historical average (see Exhibit 175). Given the current level of spreads—including higher spreads for leveraged loans, which have a weaker credit profile—our forecasts imply mid-single-digit total returns for both high yield bonds and bank loans this year. 
 European Bonds  As energy shocks roiled the continent and inflation climbed to 40-year highs, European policymakers faced an uncomfortable trade-off: sacrifice economic  
 growth by confronting inflation through tighter monetary policy or dampen the energy shock by instituting fiscal stimulus that risked pushing prices even higher. UK policymakers decided to try both at once, upsetting an already fragile European bond complex. Fortunately, subsequent BOE intervention and a tighter fiscal budget in the UK ultimately prevented broader contagion and stabilized European bond markets. Even so, yields rose sharply in 2022 and European bonds fell nearly 20%, underperforming US Treasuries.  Europe faces the same uncomfortable trade- off in 2023. With inflation pressures still elevated, energy supply impaired and the region likely in recession, policymakers must tread carefully. Our base case calls for the ECB and BOE to extend their hiking cycles to a range of 3.25–3.75% and 4.25–4.75%, respectively. Restrictive monetary policy—combined with the hit to disposable income from higher energy prices—is likely to weigh on growth significantly. Put simply, the longer rates stay in restrictive territory, the greater the odds the market will price in a deeper-cutting cycle by the end of this year. We therefore expect German and UK 10-year yields will respectively stand about 150 basis points and 125 basis points below their policy rate by year-end.  While the outlook for their prices is improving, our enthusiasm for European bonds is tempered by the elevated volatility that we expect. Inflation is likely to decrease even more

 gradually in Europe and the UK than in the US, increasing the uncertainty this year about whether inflation expectations will become unanchored. Additionally, weaker economic activity may test central bankers’ resolve and lead to more opaque forward guidance. Furthermore, both the ECB and BOE are attempting to reduce their balance sheets at a time when government issuance remains elevated, forcing the private sector to absorb record net supply in 2023 (see Exhibit 176).  Our expectation that the ECB will extend its hiking cycle—a remarkable feat following nearly a decade of negative policy rates—comes with another unique challenge. The heterogeneous nature of the currency bloc means ECB policy impacts countries differently. Consider that real rates in Italy stand more than two percentage points above those in Germany despite substantially lower potential growth. Higher funding costs in the economies least able to bear them are likely to ignite concerns around debt sustainability, putting pressure on peripheral spreads. Against this backdrop, and despite expecting German 10-year yields to fall toward our 1.75–2.25% forecast range, we recommend a neutral stance to peripheral bonds.  The BOE also faces several hurdles. First, the policy debacle last September remains fresh in investors’ minds,  
 meaning tolerance for negative surprises will be more limited and the risk premium priced into the bonds by investors more persistent. Second, the nature of the UK mortgage market results in rapid transmission of monetary policy. With around half the stock of mortgages repricing this year to much higher rates, many households will see their monthly mortgage payments double, denting disposable income. 56  Third, net supply of gilts the private sector must absorb is estimated to quadruple to £260 billion. Based on the foregoing, we expect term premium in the UK gilt market will remain elevated through 2023, supporting our 3.0–3.5% target range for 10-year gilt yields. 
 Emerging Market Local Debt  Investors fled from emerging market local debt (EMLD) in 2022. The asset class saw $44.1 billion in outflows last year, which pushed foreign holdings of domestic government securities to below the 15-year average. 57  The 11.7% loss in EMLD last year represented its second consecutive annual decline.  We think divergences across regions will be critical to the EMLD outlook in 2023. While monetary policy tightening cycles are close to ending in most EM countries, the dispersion of terminal rates is wide. Brazil and Hungary, for instance, will potentially end their cycles with policy rates near 14%, compared with near 2% in Korea and Thailand. Similarly, interest rate differentials between domestic yields and US yields are much narrower in Asia than in Latin America, Central and Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa (see Exhibit 177). These divergences should precipitate tactical opportunities during the year.  More broadly, we think EMLD could benefit this year as inflation moderates, especially if central banks begin easing cycles and fiscal policies remain prudent, keeping yield curves anchored.  
 Exhibit 176: Expected Government Bond Net Supply to the Private Sector  Increased net supply from fiscal deficits and balance sheet runoff put upward pressure on the term premium.

 94 Goldman Sachs january 2023 
 Our cautious optimism on EMLD is reflected in our mid-single-digit EMLD total return forecast for 2023, which also reflects EMLD’s 6.8% yield net of the 1.5% drag we expect from currency depreciation and 0.4% positive contribution arising from duration.  
 Emerging Market Dollar Debt  Emerging market dollar debt (EMD) was held hostage by higher US Treasury yields in 2022. As seen in Exhibit 178, EMD’s 18% loss last year represented the worst annual return since its inception in 1993. The bulk of this loss resulted from the sharp increase in US Treasury yields, as EMD spreads ended the year around their 10-year average, despite significant widening in countries such as Pakistan and Sri Lanka (see Exhibit 179).  As the market shifts its focus from high inflation to slower growth in 2023, we believe that spreads are likely to face more pressure than they did last year. History corroborates this view, as EMD spreads have typically widened by 250 basis points during mild recessions and 650 basis points during deeper global downturns. Even so, the drag from wider spreads this year should be more than offset by EMD’s yield and the benefit from its longer, nearly seven-year duration given the lower US Treasury yields we expect. Taking all these factors into account, we forecast positive low-single-digit EMD returns in 2023.

 second consecutive year. But this impressive gain belied a more nuanced reality, as returns reached 54% by early June, only to be halved in the second half of the year. Investors also faced a wide dispersion among individual commodities and their source of returns. In contrast to the index’s overall strength, both industrial metals and precious metals suffered losses last year. And while the energy subindex outperformed with a 39% gain, the bulk of this came from positive carry, or the additional return holders of a commodity get when the futures curve is strongly downward sloping, called “backwardation.” The appreciation in spot energy prices was a much smaller 14%.   The disjointed nature of these returns reflects the tug-of-war between bullish supply-side pressures and bearish demand-side concerns that is likely to continue in the year ahead. Although years of underinvestment are an underlying support for many commodity prices, a deeper global economic slowdown could quickly undermine demand, especially given the still-uncertain trajectory of China’s economy amid its shifting COVID policies.  Against these risks, we note that global inventories have remained low across most commodities despite months of weak Chinese demand—a sign of equally weak supply trends. A thinner inventory buffer also leaves prices sensitive to potential supply disruptions in politically unstable areas, such as South America for base metals, or—discussed further below—Russia and the Middle East for oil. Given these crosscurrents, we believe that risks around our base case are roughly balanced for industrial metals and oil prices this year. As for gold, we remain doubtful about its ability to provide investors with a reliable hedge against inflation or political risk given its notable failure to do so in the past year.   
 Oil: High Risks, Low Inventories  Oil prices last year were driven by geopolitical developments to a degree not seen since the turbulent 1970s. As seen in Exhibit 181, close to 10% of global oil production found itself at risk of disruption virtually overnight in the wake of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and the ensuing rollout of Western sanctions. Given already low global oil inventories and thin spare capacity, oil prices understandably spiked higher, reaching $124 at their peak closing level last March.  Prices have since fallen back below pre-war levels. This surprising retracement reflects not only the failure of supply risks to materialize, but also a combination of bearish developments, including an unprecedented 200-million-barrel release from the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve, a COVID- driven slump in Chinese oil demand and fears of an impending recession.

  Although oil prices have receded, the bullish risks that underpinned their initial spike higher have not disappeared. The full effect of European sanctions on Russia will not be visible in energy markets until the first quarter of this year. These curbs directly impact 0.5 million b/d of seaborne crude oil and 1.1 million b/d of refined products. While Russia has so far been successful at redirecting crude exports to India and China, this strategy is starting to show some limits (see Exhibit 182). Moreover, it will be difficult for Russia to replicate this strategy in refined products, as both China and India were net exporters in this category last year.  As a result, close to 2 million b/d of Russian supplies to Europe remain at risk. Consensus currently expects a net loss of less than half that amount, increasing the risk of an upside surprise. Upward pressure on energy prices could also arise from supply disruptions in other countries, given geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and domestic instability in Libya and other exporting countries.   To be sure, the demand for oil faces an equally high degree of risk amid a potential US recession and the still-uncertain trajectory of China’s economy. We estimate that Chinese demand fell by 0.5 million b/d on average last year, marking the first annual decline since 1990 (see Exhibit 183). While a successful reopening of China’s economy could help offset weaker oil demand elsewhere, a more protracted  
 COVID wave could exacerbate demand concerns. For now, we expect global demand to remain on an upward trajectory in our base case, exceeding pre- COVID levels by year-end.   Meeting this demand will require continuing growth from US producers, as OPEC has already ramped its output back to pre-COVID levels and has limited spare capacity. But to incentivize additional drilling, oil prices must remain high enough to overcome the cost inflation and self- imposed capital discipline now holding back US production. In contrast, lower prices and disappointing demand would likely restrain production growth. Tellingly, the November and December oil price slump was rapidly followed by a decline in US drilling and completion activity, while OPEC immediately announced a production cut to rescue prices.  Given these moving pieces, we expect WTI prices to trade in a $70–100 range by year-end, which would imply upside from current levels. But we are mindful of the many risks that could undermine this forecast—including a US recession, another wave of global COVID infections or a quick resolution to the conflict in Ukraine—any one of which could push prices down to cost support near $60. That said, we would not expect these lower prices to be sustained for an extended period, given producers’ likely reaction. There are also upside risks. Any additional supply disruptions would be magnified by still-low inventories (see

 Gold: Not as Advertised  Since its meteoric rise in the 1970s, gold has been hailed as an effective hedge against inflation. But that reputation was tarnished in 2022, as gold prices spent most of the year trading in negative territory despite the highest inflation in four decades. This disappointing performance was yet another reminder that gold is subject to a multitude of often opposing factors. Case in point: the impact of last year’s inflation surprise was largely offset by the combination of higher interest rates and the surge in the US dollar, with which gold tends to be negatively correlated.  These types of crosscurrents leave us tactically neutral on gold again this year. As seen in Exhibit 185, our expectation for softer nominal and real interest rates removes one of last year’s key headwinds to gold. Yet real rates are still likely to remain in positive territory, which historically has resulted in lower-than-average gold returns (see Exhibit 186). After all, positive interest rates create an opportunity cost of holding gold, which  
 generates no cash flow or yield income and must be physically stored, often at a cost.  We also do not see a compelling argument for investors to replace their US dollar holdings with gold this year, given our still constructive view on the currency. Consider that since 1971, there has been only a 24% chance of a meaningful gold

 rally of more than 10% in periods when the dollar was stable or rising. In fact, most meaningful gold rallies have happened when the US dollar was depreciating. Put simply, when the dollar is appreciating—a situation we expect this year— the low probability of strong gold returns has not historically justified the risk and volatility of holding the yellow metal.    Still, there are a few factors that could buoy gold, not the least of which is a US recession that might rekindle demand for gold as a safe-haven asset. Gold also stands to benefit if currently underweight investors increase their positions (see Exhibit 187), which now stand 28% below their recent peak in early 2022 and back at levels last seen in early 2020. Demand from EM central banks looking to diversify their FX reserves into gold is another source of upside risk. The latest data from the World Gold Council already points to record-high purchases in the most recent quarter, with countries such as Turkey, China and India leading the pack. Further geopolitical strife could even accelerate this trend.   Given these contradictory factors, we remain neutral on gold until a clearer opportunity presents itself.  
 Exhibit 187: Investor Positioning in Gold  While still historically elevated, investor length in gold is well off its peak.

As part of GSFO Services, GSFO may discuss with you various aspects of financial planning, including but not necessarily limited to the potential income tax consequences of your investments, estate planning, philanthropic endeavors, and certain other activities that may affect your income tax, gift tax and estate tax. GSFO Services vary among clients, are provided based on individual client needs and preferences, and are generally limited to educational consultations that should not be viewed as tax or legal advice. GSFO does not provide investment advice, investment management services, or advise on or offer the sale of insurance products. GSFO Services are offered in the United States through GS&Co. but may also be provided in part by Ayco. Ayco may, separately and distinctly from GSFO Services, provide tax and insurance advice in addition to personal family office services (“Ayco Family Office Services”). We encourage you to clearly establish your set of services with your advisory team.  
 Investment Strategy Group (“ISG”).  The Investment Strategy Group, part of the Asset & Wealth Management business (“AWM”) of GS, focuses on asset allocation strategy formation and market analysis for GS Wealth Management. Any information that references ISG, including their model portfolios, represents the views of ISG, is not financial research and is not a product of GS Global Investment Research and may vary significantly from views expressed by individual portfolio management teams within AWM, or other groups at GS. ISG Model Portfolios are provided for illustrative purposes only. Your actual asset allocation may look significantly different based on your particular  
 circumstances and risk tolerance. Model performance calculations assume that (1) each asset class was owned in accordance with the recommended weight; (2) all tactical tilts were tracked at the time the recommendation was made; and (3) the portfolios are rebalanced at the end of every quarter. Model performance is calculated using the daily returns (actual or interpolated) of indices that ISG believes are representative of the asset classes included in the model. Results shown reflect the total return but generally do not consider any investment management fees, commissions or other transaction expenses, which would reduce returns. Hedge fund indices and data from Cambridge Associates are net of manager fees. The results shown reflect the reinvestment of dividends and other earnings. All returns are pre- tax and are not adjusted for inflation. Additional information about the model portfolio performance calculations is available upon request.  
 Investment Risks and Information.  GS&Co. offers a range of products that you should carefully consider for their unique terms and risks prior to investing to ensure they are appropriate for your individual circumstances. Below are descriptions of major risks for our more complex products; please review the offering documents and product prospectuses for particular products, as well as additional information about the nature and risks of these and other products in GS&Co.’s ADV Part 2A Brochure and PWM Relationship Guide. Investing involves the risk of loss.  
 Alternative Investments (“AI”).  AIs may involve a substantial degree of risk, including the risk of total loss of capital, use of leverage, lack of liquidity, and volatility of returns. Private equity, private credit, private real estate, hedge funds, and AI investments structured as private investment funds are subject to less regulation than other types of pooled vehicles. Review the Offering Memorandum, Subscription Agreement, and any other applicable offering documents for risks, potential conflicts of interest, terms and conditions and other disclosures.  
 Commodities.  The risk of loss in trading commodities can be substantial due, but not limited, to lack of liquidity, volatile political, market, and economic conditions, and abrupt changes in price which may result from unpredictable factors including weather, labor strikes, inflation, foreign exchange rates, etc. Due to the use of leverage, a small move against your position may result in a loss that may be larger than your initial deposit. 
 Currencies.  Currency exchange rates can be extremely volatile, particularly during times of political or economic uncertainty. There is a risk of loss when  
 an investor has exposure to foreign currency or holds foreign currency traded investments. 
 Digital Assets/Cryptocurrency.  Digital assets regulation is still developing across all jurisdictions and governments may in the future restrict the use and exchange of any or all digital assets. Digital assets are generally not backed nor supported by any government or central bank, are not FDIC insured and do not have the same protections that U.S. or other countries’ bank deposits may have and are more volatile than traditional currencies. Transacting in digital assets carries the risk of market manipulation and cybersecurity failures such as the risk of hacking, theft, programming bugs, and accidental loss. Differing forms of digital assets may carry different risks. The volatility and unpredictability of the price of digital assets may lead to significant and immediate losses. 
 Over-the-Counter (“OTC”) Derivatives.  OTC derivatives are illiquid as there is no public market. The price or valuation of each OTC derivative transaction is individually negotiated between GS&Co. and each counterparty, and GS&Co. does not represent or warrant that the prices for which it offers OTC derivative transactions are the best prices available. You may therefore have trouble establishing whether the price you have been offered for a particular OTC derivative transaction is fair. OTC derivatives may trade at a value that is different from the level inferred from interest rates, dividends, and the underlier due to factors including expectations of future levels of interest rates and dividends, and the volatility of the underlier prior to maturity. The market price of the OTC derivative transaction may be influenced by many unpredictable factors, including economic conditions, GS creditworthiness, the value of any underliers, and certain actions taken by GS. Because GS may be obligated to make substantial payments to you as a condition of an OTC derivative transaction, you must evaluate the credit risk of doing business with GS. Depending on the type of transaction, your counterparty may be GS&Co. or another GS affiliate. Counterparties may be subject to different rules depending on whether they are a registered U.S. broker dealer. OTC derivative transactions with GS affiliates cannot be assigned or transferred without GS’s prior written consent. The provisions of an OTC derivative transaction may allow for early termination and, in such cases, either you or GS may be required to make a potentially significant termination payment depending upon whether the OTC derivative transaction is in-the-money at the time of termination. You should carefully review the Master Agreement, including any related schedules, credit

 support documents, addenda, and exhibits. You may be requested to post margin or collateral at levels consistent with the internal policies of GS to support written OTC derivatives 
 Emerging Markets and Growth Markets.  Emerging markets and growth markets investments involve certain considerations, including political and economic conditions, the potential difficulty of repatriating funds or enforcing contractual or other legal rights, and the small size of the securities markets in such countries coupled with a low volume of trading, resulting in potential lack of liquidity and price volatility. 
 Non-US Securities.  Non-US securities investments are subject to differing regulations, less public information, less liquidity, and greater volatility in the countries of domicile of the security issuers and/or the jurisdiction in which these securities are traded. In addition, investors in securities such as ADRs/ GDRs, whose values are influenced by foreign currencies, effectively assume currency risk. 
 Options.  The purchase of options can result in the loss of an entire investment and the risk of uncovered options is potentially unlimited. You must read and understand the current Options Disclosure Document before entering into any options transactions. The booklet entitled Characteristics and Risk of Standardized Options can be obtained from your PWM team or at http://www.theocc.com/components/ docs/riskstoc.pdf. A secondary market may not be available for all options. Transaction costs may be significant in option strategies that require multiple purchases and sales of options, such as spreads. Supporting documentation for any comparisons, recommendations, statistics, technical data, or other information will be supplied upon request.  
 Real Estate.  Real estate investments, including real estate investments trusts (“REITS”) and non-traded REITS, involve additional risks not typically associated with other asset classes. Such investments (both through public and private markets) may be subject to changes in broader macroeconomic conditions, such as interest rates, and sensitivities to temporary or permanent reductions in property values for the geographic region(s) represented. Non-traded REITS may carry a higher risk of illiquidity, incomplete or nontransparent valuations, dilution of shares, and conflicts of interest.  
 Structured Investments.  Structured investments are complex and investors assume the credit risk of the issuer or guarantor. If the issuer or guarantor defaults, you may lose your entire investment, even if you hold the product to maturity. Structured  
 investments often perform differently from the asset(s) they reference. Credit ratings may pertain to the credit rating of the issuer and are not indicative of the market risk associated with the structured investment or the reference asset. Each structured investment is different, and for each investment you should consider 1) the possibility that at expiration you may be forced to own the reference asset at a depressed price; 2) limits on the ability to share in upside appreciation; 3) the potential for increased losses if the reference asset declines; and 4) potential inability to sell given the lack of a public trading market. 
 Tactical Tilts.  Tactical tilts may involve a high degree of risk. No assurance can be made that profits will be achieved or that substantial losses will not be incurred. For various reasons, GS may implement a tactical tilt, invest in an affiliated fund that may invest in tactical tilts, or unwind a position for its client advisory accounts or on its own behalf before your advisor does on behalf of your account, or may implement a tactical tilt that is different from the tactical tilt implemented by advisors on client accounts, which could have an adverse effect on your account and may result in poorer performance by your account than by GS or other client accounts. 
 U.S. Registered Mutual Funds / Exchange Traded Funds (“ETFs”) or Exchange Traded Notes (“ETNs”).  You should consider a fund’s investment objectives, risks, and costs, and read the summary prospectus and/or the Prospectus (which may be obtained from your PWM Team) carefully before investing. You may obtain documents for ETFs or ETNs for free by 1) visiting EDGAR on the SEC website at http:// www.sec.gov/; 2) contacting your PWM Team; or 3) calling toll-free at 1-866-471-2526. Unlike traditional mutual funds, ETFs can trade at a discount or premium to the net asset value and are not directly redeemable by the fund. Leveraged or inverse ETFs, ETNs, or commodities futures-linked ETFs may experience greater price movements than traditional ETFs and may not be appropriate for all investors. Most leveraged and inverse ETFs or ETNs seek to deliver multiples of the performance (or the inverse of the performance) of the underlying index or benchmark on a daily basis. Their performance over a longer period of time can vary significantly from the stated daily performance objectives or the underlying benchmark or index due to the effects of compounding. Performance differences may be magnified in a volatile market. Commodities futures-linked ETFs may perform differently than the spot price for the commodity itself, including due to the entering into and liquidating of futures or swap contracts on a continuous basis to maintain exposure  
 (i.e., “rolling”) and disparities between near term future prices and long term future prices for the underlying commodity. You should not assume that a commodity-futures linked ETF will provide an effective hedge against other risks in your portfolio. 
 Security-Specific References.  References to a specific company or security are intended solely as examples or for context and are not research or investment advice; do not rely upon them in making an investment decision. GS may have a relationship with such companies and/or its securities that may present conflicts of interest. Contact your PWM Team for further information on any securities mentioned.  
 Off-Platform Investments.  If you ask us for guidance on external investment opportunities not offered by GS, any information we may provide is as an accommodation only and we will not be acting as your advisor. We assume no obligation to determine whether the opportunity is suitable for you in connection with such investment decisions and will not assume any liability for such investment decisions. Our Form ADV has information on conflicts of interest we may have in connection with any such requests. ISG/GIR Forecasts. Economic and market forecasts presented (“forecasts”) generally reflect either ISG’s or Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research’s (“GIR”) views and are subject to change without notice. Forecasts do not consider investment objectives, restrictions, tax and financial situations or other needs of any specific client. Forecasts are subject to high levels of uncertainty that may affect actual performance and represents only one of a broad range of possible outcomes. Forecasts and any return expectations are as of the date of this material, and do not project returns of any given investment or strategy. Forecasts are estimated, based on capital market assumptions, and are subject to significant revision and may change materially as economic and market conditions change. Any case studies and examples are for illustrative purposes only. If applicable, a copy of the GIR Report used for GIR forecasts is available upon request. Forecasts do not reflect advisory fees, transaction costs, and other expenses a client would have paid, which would reduce return. 
 Client Specific Markets.  Investments held in your name with a subcustodian in the local market where traded in order to comply with local law will be indicated on your statements. 
 Performance / Estimated Income / Estimated Cash Flow.  Past performance is not a guide of future results and may include investments no longer owned in current or closed  
 accounts. Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data quoted. Where not relevant or representative, outliers may be excluded. To request the most current or historical performance data, or asset classification schema information, please contact your PWM team at the number provided on your monthly statement or toll-free in the U.S. at 1-800-323-5678.  
 Performance reports, where shown, generally present the relevant time weighted performance, which is a combination of daily returns compounded over a specified time period with the removal of the deposit and withdrawal impacts, and may show internal rate of return calculations where requested. Aggregate performance may not equal the sum of returns at an investment level. Where performance is shown net of fees, actual fees may differ. Net performance for advisory accounts is calculated net of fees and expenses that were or would have been paid in connection with GS’s services, including management fees, and might include investments for which actual market prices are not currently available. If included, estimated income figures and estimated private equity future cash flows are estimates of future activity, and actual results may vary substantially. GS&Co. has adjusted performance calculations for certain asset classes or strategies and may do so in the future. Performance of net cash (i.e., cash less margin debit) is generally included in the total performance calculation but not displayed separately. Option performance is included in the performance of the asset class of the underlier.  
 Offer to Provide Additional Performance Information.  Where GS provides you with the results of a subset of investments extracted from a portfolio (“extracted performance”), you may request the performance results of the total portfolio. Where GS provides you with illustrative performance regarding private fund investments that was not actually achieved by GS (“hypothetical performance”), you may request additional information regarding the risks and limitations of using such performance.  
 Indices/Benchmarks.  References to indices, benchmarks, or other measures of relative market performance over a specified period are informational only and are not predictions or guarantees of performance. In addition to the benchmark assigned to a specific investment strategy, other benchmarks (“Comparative Benchmarks”) may be displayed, including ones displayed at your request. Managers may not review the performance of your

 account against the performance of Comparative Benchmarks. Where a benchmark for a strategy has changed, the historical benchmark(s) are available upon request. Inception to date (“ITD”) returns and benchmark/ reference portfolio returns may reflect different periods. ITD returns for accounts or asset classes only reflect performance during periods in which your account(s) held assets and/ or were invested in the asset class. The benchmark or reference portfolio returns shown reflect the benchmark / portfolio performance from the date of inception of your account or your initial investment in the asset class. If displayed, estimated income figures are estimates of future activity obtained from third party sources. Indices are unmanaged and investors cannot directly invest in them. The figures for the index reflect the reinvestment of all income or dividends, as applicable, but may not always reflect the deduction of any fees or expenses which would reduce returns. Where appropriate, relevant index trademarks or index information has been licensed or sub-licensed for use. Inclusion of index information does not mean the relevant index or its affiliated entities sponsor, endorse, sell, or promote the referenced securities, or that they make any representation or warranty regarding either the advisability of investing in securities or the ability of the index to track market performance.  
 Pricing and Valuations.  Prices do not necessarily reflect realizable values and are based on information considered to be reliable but are not guaranteed for accuracy, currency, or as realizable values. Certain positions may be provided by third parties or may appear without a price if GS is unable to obtain a price and/or the security is not actively traded for a certain amount of time. Pricing sources and methods are available upon request and are subject to change. 
 Consolidated Reporting and Third Party Investments.  Where GS provides a consolidated report or references information regarding your non-GS investments held by third party custodians, such information provided as a courtesy for informational purposes only; it is not your official statement. Such information (including valuof any materials/information provided to us. GS does not perform review or diligence on, independently verify the accuracy of information regarding, or provide advice on such non-GS investments; GS assumes no responsibility for the accuracy of the source information and such assets may not be included on GS’s books and records. Unless otherwise agreed in writing, we have not assessed whether those investments fit within your investment objective and the asset classification shown may not be accurate and/or may differ from your custodian  
 or external adviser’s classification. You should maintain the original source documents (including third party financial statements) and review them for any notices or relevant disclosures. Assets held away may not be covered by SIPC.  
 Tax Information.  GS does not provide legal, tax or accounting advice, unless explicitly agreed in writing between you and GS, and does not offer the sale of insurance products. You should obtain your own independent tax advice based on your circumstances.

 GSFO Services.  Where GS&Co. provides or refers GSFO Services, it does so based on individual client needs. Not all clients will receive all services and certain activities may fall beyond the scope of the GSFO Services. Any asset management services provided are governed by a separate investment management agreement (as may be applicable). Personnel providing GSFO Services do not provide discretionary management over client investments. Where GSFO provides art or collectibles advisory services, such services are generally limited to education; GS does not recommend purchasing art or collectibles as an investment strategy, provide formal or informal appraisals of the value  
 of, or opine on the future investment potential of, any specific artwork or collectible. Any discussions of pending legislation, or hypothetical projections based on same, are educational and should not be construed as or relied upon as investment, tax, or legal advice. Upon your request, the Family Office team may discuss with you various aspects of financial planning; the scope of such planning services will vary among clients and may only include episodic and educational consultations that should not be viewed as tax advice. GS&Co. assumes no duty to take action pursuant to any recommendations, advice, or financial planning strategies discussed with you as part of GSFO Services. It is your responsibility to determine if and how any such recommendations, advice, or financial planning strategies should be implemented or otherwise followed, and you are encouraged to consult with your own tax advisor and other professionals regarding your specific circumstances. GS is not liable for any services received from your independent advisors or the results of any incident arising from any such services or advice. Cybersecurity consultations provided by GS&Co. are intended to provide a general overview of cyber and physical security threats, but are not comprehensive; GS is not liable for any incident following such consultations. GS&Co. is not liable for clients’ ultimate selection and utilization of any Third Party Vendor for any GSFO Services, or the results of any incident arising from any such referral. GS&Co. is not responsible for the supervision, monitoring, management, or performance of such Third Party Vendors and is not liable for any failure of Third Party Vendors to render services or any losses incurred as a result of such services. Ayco Family Office Services may also be offered through Ayco. These services are separate and distinct from those services provided by GSFO, and may vary substantially.  
 Other Services.  Any provided financial planning services, including cash flow analyses based on information you provide, are hypothetical illustrations of mathematical principles and are not a prediction or projection of performance of an investment or investment strategy. Certain illustrations may be predicated on an Investment Analysis tool, an interactive technological tool that produces simulations and statistical analyses that present the likelihood of various investment outcomes based on client input. Such services may not address every aspect of a client’s financial life; topics that were not discussed with you may still be relevant to your financial situation. In providing financial services, GS relies on information provided by you and is not responsible for the accuracy or completeness of any such information,  
 nor for any consequences related to the use of any inaccurate or incomplete information. Where materials and/ or analyses are provided to you, they are based on the assumptions stated therein, which are likely to vary substantially from the examples shown if they do not prove to be true. These examples are for illustrative purposes only and do not guarantee that any client will or is likely to achieve the results shown. Assumed growth rates are subject to high levels of uncertainty and do not represent actual trading and may not reflect material economic and market factors that may have an impact on actual performance. GS has no obligation to provide updates to these rates. 
 Not a Municipal Advisor.  Except where GS expressly agrees otherwise, GS is not acting as a municipal advisor and the opinions or views contained in this presentation are not intended to be, and do not constitute, advice, including within the meaning of Section 15B of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

 Foreword   
 Every year presents unique challenges. In 2020, together we confronted a global pandemic and lockdown. In 2021, global economies slowly reopened as parts of the world returned to more normal patterns of life.    
 2022 has brought new headwinds, some we haven’t seen in over 40 years.  
 As inflation proved more resilient than anticipated, rising to highs we haven’t seen in decades, central banks aggressively raised rates to slow its progress. With both stocks and bonds suffering significant losses, 2022 delivered one of the worst years ever for balanced portfolios.  
 From a geopolitical perspective, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine caused great human suffering and disrupted global markets.  
 To prepare for the year ahead, we rely on our world-class Global Investment Strategy Group to help us identify both the risks and opportunities that investors may face. Despite the headwinds to growth, they see the potential for stronger markets in 2023 and beyond.  
 In times like these, we rely on each other and on the relationships we have created over time. We are honored to stand by your side.   
 Thank you for your continued trust and confidence in J.P. Morgan.

 David Frame  CEO, U.S. Private Bank

  Highlights from the 2023 Outlook   
 1.   
 The best in a decade. A dramatic reset in valuations  has, in our view, created the most attractive entry point for stocks and bonds in over a decade.  
 2.   
 Bad news, good news. The bad news: We think a  recession is likely in 2023. The good news: Central  banks should stop hiking and inflation will likely fall.  
 3.   
 Bonds are back. Core fixed income now offers the  potential for protection, yield and capital appreciation.   
 4.   
 Reversal of fortunes. We expect mega-cap   technology stocks to underperform and small  cap stocks to outperform.  
 5.  
 Real money. The era of underinvestment in the real economy is over.

 INTRODUCTION  
 In this year’s outlook, we evaluate the fallout from a historic global tightening cycle—higher interest rates will rein in inflation, but recessions are likely in the United States and Europe—and we assess the degree to which market pricing already reflects a future downturn.  
 Even as economic growth deteriorates, we think markets could stabilize in 2023.  
 Higher bond yields offer total return potential, and they could provide portfolios with valuable ballast during a downturn. Equity markets may remain challenged by weaker earnings growth, but stock prices now incorporate a substantial degree of future damage.   
 Precisely because markets are so battered, lower equity valuations and higher bond yields, in our view, mean that investors now enjoy the most attractive entry point for a traditional portfolio in over a decade. Already, market dislocations have appeared that investors can take advantage of. Those with capital to invest can find the potential for compelling returns across asset classes and risk levels.   
 As you design and revise your goals-based plan, that’s welcome news indeed.

 WEAKER GROWTH  
 As of late 2022, 26 of the 31 central banks that we track were raising rates, up from just two at the start of 2021. The Federal Reserve (Fed) engaged in its most aggressive round of interest rate hikes in 40 years.  
 The European Central Bank (ECB) has been no less forceful, recently raising its policy rate by 0.75% to levels last seen before the global financial crisis (GFC). And the ECB seems set to keep raising rates despite the clear threats to growth.  
 After a little over a decade of low or negative policy rates, the campaign against inflation caused a historic rout in bond markets. The Barclays Global Aggregate Index is on track to lose over 10% in 2022, its worst year on record. Negative yielding debt (a pervasive feature of the post-GFC landscape) has disappeared everywhere except Japan.

 WEAKER GROWTH  
 Across the global economy, many households and companies are facing suddenly higher borrowing costs.  
 11  
 In the United States, rates for new 30-year mortgages breached 7%, up from ~3.25% at the start of 2022, and housing affordability has fallen to its lowest level since 2007. The economic hit is even more notable in Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and Canada, where 10%–20% of households will face higher payments on existing mortgages starting next year.  
 Inflation remains well above central bank targets, but we note a subtle shift in monetary policy. Central banks in Australia, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland and Canada have all moved to a slower pace of tightening. The Fed will likely follow suit to assess the effects of its tightening cycle—higher rates impact the economy with a lag.  
 The rate hiking campaigns will likely come to an end in 2023, but the historic pace of hikes has already posed serious risks to global economic growth.

 WEAKER GROWTH  
 Higher rates will likely rein in growth  
 In many economies, monetary policy is now restricting growth.  
 In the United States, most members of the Fed’s Federal Open Market Committee think a “neutral” policy rate that neither restrains nor stimulates economic growth is around 2.5%. That’s well below the current policy rate. Several Fed governors have argued for a pause in rate hikes in the first quarter of 2023, concerned they could go too far in their efforts to control inflation.

 TREASURY YIELD CURVE IS DEEPLY INVERTED 
 Spread between 2­ and 10­year Treasury yield, bps 
   
   
 WEAKER GROWTH  
 Markets seem to agree that interest rates are restrictive. Most yield curves are deeply inverted, and Treasury rates at most tenors are trading above the expected rate of inflation over the same period.  
 Higher interest rates are meant to slow the economy in part by discouraging companies and households from borrowing. So far, they are doing just that.  
 Activity in interest rate–sensitive sectors such as real estate has already declined dramatically. Instead of moving or refinancing mortgages to build new additions, homeowners are sitting tight. Capital markets are likewise dormant as companies balk at higher financing costs. Globally, issuance of corporate debt is down ~80%, and initial public offerings are USD600 billion lower than they were in 2021.  
 Because most financial transactions and trade are denominated in dollars, a strong USD (itself a function of Fed rate hikes and the war in Ukraine) adds another source of resistance for global economic activity. In addition, increased volatility in capital markets could reduce corporate confidence and dampen investment and hiring plans.  
 Given the lagged effects of higher rates, we expect weakness from housing, capital markets and technology to spread in 2023.

 WEAKER GROWTH  
 Labor  markets will likely soften  
 While the unemployment rate is low and jobs growth is still healthy in the United States, demand for labor may be past its peak.  
 Both the job openings rate and the quits rate have declined, albeit to elevated levels. Average hourly earnings seem to have hit their high-water mark and are now rising at a ~4.5% pace. Corporate earnings reports also suggest moderating labor demand and cost pressure.  
 These data points signal that the Fed is getting its desired effect of lower demand for workers. But success is far from assured, and turning points in the labor market are difficult to identify in real time.  
 As demand erodes and corporate profit margins deteriorate, more companies will likely freeze hiring or lay off workers to cut costs. Many companies that were darlings of the social- distancing era (e.g., Amazon, Peloton and Meta) have done so already.  
 We expect the unemployment rate to rise in 2023 as higher rates broadly slow the economy.

 WEAKER GROWTH  A bumpy path  back to trend  inflation  
 We see evidence that inflation is on track to fall, but how far and how fast? The data has improved on several fronts: global supply chains, commodities and goods prices.  
 Supply chain pressures—the result of excess demand for goods during the pandemic—have largely eased. Delivery times as measured by Purchasing Manager Index (PMI) surveys have fallen to average levels. Shipping costs have collapsed by around 70% from their peaks.  
 In the commodities sector, the picture is mixed across economies, but prices generally look to be heading lower. Global industrial commodities prices are down more than 35% from their highs and are negative on a year-over-year basis. Prices for oil and natural gas likewise seem past their peaks, though geopolitical factors play a key role here. War in Ukraine leaves Europe grappling with a precarious energy supply.

 Still, services inflation remains stubbornly high, a reflection of tight labor markets. The U.S. official rent and owners' equivalent rent inflation, which accounts for roughly one- third of overall U.S. inflation measures, will probably stay elevated (though private measures suggest that rent increases are decelerating rapidly). Given the signals from private measures, we are looking for softer rental inflation readings by the middle of next year.   
 Globally, we think inflation will continue its downward trajectory throughout 2023, reaching levels consistent with most central bank targets by 2024.  
 Weaker growth, softer labor markets and falling inflation will likely lead to the end of the global rate hiking cycle in 2023. Investors may at first glance welcome the news. But historical evidence suggests that the real economy suffers the greatest damage after interest rates have already risen.

 United States: Recession more  likely than not   
 While growth in the United States has been relatively resilient, we think it is only a matter of time before debt defaults pick up and workers lose their jobs.  
 Typically, tightening cycles first impact interest rate–sensitive sectors. Later, they lead to job losses across the economy—sometimes even 12–18 months after rates reach restrictive levels. We expect to see more job cuts in the technology, residential real estate and manufacturing sectors.

 China:  Ongoing property  and COVID woes  
 In China, the fallout from the collapsing property sector and the government’s commitment to zero COVID policies could continue to rein in GDP growth.  
 Exports are running above pre-COVID rates, but building sales and new construction growth are plummeting and as of yet show no signs of a turn. Recent policy announcements signal more government support, but we will be looking for confirmation from the data.  
 Chinese policymakers are directing investment to infrastructure development. Yet the modest growth impulse has been thwarted by the stop- start cycle of COVID lockdowns as well as the troubled property sector. Through 2023, we may see a slow pivot toward reopening, but it will likely be staggered and careful.

 Latin America:  A (relative) bright spot   
 For nearly two years, Latin America has outperformed other emerging and developed markets both in terms of growth and market performance.  
 Despite the aggressive Fed tightening cycle, major currencies in the region strengthened in 2022. The Brazilian real and Mexican peso rose 9% and 5.5%, respectively.  
 Latin American central banks were among the first to start hiking rates in 2021. By the end of 2022, most were able to pause, and it’s possible they could start lowering rates by the middle of 2023. This would provide an important tailwind for Latin America’s equity markets, which are trading at some of their lowest valuations over the last 15 years.

 For 2023, we think investors can focus on two central questions:  
 What assets might help protect my portfolio through a recession?  Our answer: Core bonds.  
 How much future damage to cash flows and corporate earnings do risk assets already reflect? Our answer: Substantial risk—but likely not all.  
 We think investors can now find opportunity in core bonds, preferred equities, small- and mid-cap stocks, and infrastructure and transportation assets.

 Only a few quarters ago, traditional fixed income faced a serious challenge: It provided neither compelling levels of income nor adequate protection against an economic downturn. Today, with Treasury, corporate and municipal bond yields at their highest levels in a decade, both income and portfolio ballast are once again on offer.  
 That’s a change that all investors should pay attention to.  
 Current yields in many parts of the fixed income complex are now equivalent to historical equity returns. This could give investors an opportunity to reach their goals while taking less risk. As interest rates fall in a recession, longer-duration core fixed income (e.g., investment-grade corporates or municipal bonds) could provide potential total returns well into the teens.

 In fact, market pricing suggests that short-term interest rates will remain above 3.1% for the better part of the next decade. We believe that outcome is unlikely, and think investors should lock in elevated yields now.  
 Moving beyond core fixed income, potential returns and risks are greater when we consider less creditworthy issuers or securities that are subordinate in the capital structure.  
 As we assess the asset class, the high yield bond market is pricing in a deceleration in economic growth and deterioration in credit quality, but not yet an outright recession. Even so, its all-in yield of nearly 10% offers an attractive alternative to equity exposure even after accounting for potential losses from default.  
 Meanwhile, preferred equities could be interesting for some investors. They display characteristics of both fixed income (prices are determined in part by interest rates) and equities (they react to changing perceptions about corporate earnings). Both rising rates and concerns about economic growth sparked a ~20% drawdown in these securities so far this year.  
 We like the entry point for preferred equities. Unlike high yield bonds, default risk is more limited, given that investment grade companies are the most common issuers. What’s more, prices could rebound if yields decline. U.S. taxpayers also benefit from the qualified dividend income tax treatment of the coupons.

 No one knows precisely when stock markets will bottom. But a ~20% decline in stocks is relatively rare and has historically presented the best entry points for investors with medium- to long-term time horizons. This cycle should be no different.  
 In 2023, we believe equities are well positioned to deliver positive returns. Any material decline from current levels could represent a good buying opportunity.  
 Turning first to the U.S. market, analysts do seem a little too optimistic in projecting earnings growth of nearly 7.5% for the S&P 500 in 2023. We are penciling in flat-to-negative earnings growth in light of a weakening economic backdrop.  
 But earnings expectations are just one part of the equation. In the United States, as inflation subsides, the tightening cycle nears its end and rates hit their ceiling, we expect equity valuations to expand.  
 Together those two factors should deliver modest positive returns for the S&P 500 next year. Clearly, taming inflation is a prerequisite for stock market gains.  
 We could see some rotation in market sectors. Investors may move back into interest rate–sensitive sectors (such as real estate and reasonably priced technology) as bond yields peak, and exit cyclical sectors that could be at risk if markets price in greater risk of recession.  
 The picture is mixed across regions. Although current valuations in Europe and China seem attractive, we think U.S. dollar–based investors should wait for a clearer turn lower in the dollar and a turn higher in the global manufacturing cycle before boosting their non-U.S. equity exposures. We may get the chance, as the U.S. dollar looks very stretched relative to historical valuations.  
 We believe equities  will deliver positive  total returns in 2023.

 Emerging markets outside of China could offer some interesting trading opportunities. Brazilian equities seem attractive on a valuation basis, and we like South Korea’s exposure to the semiconductor industry. Over the longer term, structural trends such as food scarcity and reliance on oil (despite progress toward the clean energy transition) will likely offset idiosyncratic risks in regions such as the Middle East and Latin America.  
 As the cycle progresses, we may find an opportunity to add to most emerging markets in 2023.     
 On a regional basis, we prefer U.S. stocks, which tend to be more insulated from global downturns.  
 On a sector level, we prefer healthcare. Revenues aren’t as cyclical as they are in other sectors, and valuations seem reasonable. We also see opportunity in quality, cash flow–generating tech and tech-related companies that were hit by higher interest rates. Industrial companies provide some inflation protection and benefit from the tailwind of global infrastructure and defense investment. Dividend growth and value companies could be well positioned, given the uncertain macro environment and higher interest rates.  
 A trend that we think will continue into 2023: Under- performance of the mega-cap tech leaders of the last cycle relative to the broad market.  
 We also think investors should now consider small- and mid-cap companies.  
 Generally, smaller companies tend to grow faster than large caps, benefit from merger and acquisition activity, and could be somewhat insulated from a more stringent regulatory environment.  
 Valuations have fallen to recessionary levels and may already reflect a material decline in earnings. During recessions, small- and mid-cap companies only underperform large-cap stocks by ~5%, and they outperform large-cap stocks by 30% in the first year of the recovery. We think the time to add is now.  
 As the year progresses, we will be on the lookout for other dislocated pockets of the market.

 Once-booming private markets have started to feel the strain that is all but inescapable in public markets.  
 Growth equity funds, real estate vehicles and private credit managers have all experienced varying degrees of markdowns on their assets, and more seem likely.  
 On the other hand, other alternative investments such as hedge funds that focus on rates, currencies and cross-asset correlations had a banner year and proved their worth as portfolio diversifiers. In 2023, gold may serve a similar purpose as the dollar and real interest rates find their peaks.   
 More immediately, the drought of public capital market activity in 2022 means that private market investors can earn a premium for providing both debt and equity financing. Companies that were planning on an initial public offering in 2022 or 2023 are holding back, given the valuation reset. Instead, many of these firms are turning to private investors for bridge capital, and private lenders can now demand higher interest rates from potential borrowers.  
 Similarly, secondary private equity offerings, which have historically demonstrated higher net IRRs (internal rates of return) with more limited manager dispersion than other types of private equity investments, could provide an opportunity to acquire discounted assets from owners who are willing to accept a markdown in exchange for immediate liquidity.

 Going forward, we may also see distressed opportunities in real estate and credit as the growth backdrop deteriorates.  
 As we move into 2023 and beyond, we think there will be a renewed focus on stability and security across the global economy. The pandemic and shifting geopolitical risks have raised acute issues in areas such as supply chain resilience, access to energy, food and other natural resources, and traditional and digital security.  
 Real assets such as infrastructure, transportation and the energy transition create a wide range of possibilities for both public and private investors.  
 Many sectors, such as residential real estate (U.S. housing stock has been underbuilt by ~1.5 million homes), shipping (there are only 111 active large shipyards today versus 320 in 2008), and natural resources (large-cap energy capex is down 60% since 2015) have seen a decade of underinvestment that curtails capacity. The investment shortfall presents opportunity for  both yield and total return, though cyclical risks should be taken into account.

 Europe will likely need to redesign its energy infrastructure and supply chain, which should benefit not only natural gas producers and transporters, but also accelerate the green energy transition. Nuclear energy may even start to become a more acceptable option.  
 Across the global economy, critical infrastructure will continue to provide investors with steady income streams under a wide variety of macroeconomic conditions.  
 All in all, we rely on private investments to add diversification benefits to portfolios, to target market inefficiencies in opportunistic areas, and to drive attractive returns relative to public benchmarks. Our outlook for 2023 makes those qualities even more valuable.

 CONCLUSION  
 2022 tested the resolve of many investors.  Equity markets experienced one of their worst  drawdowns on record. Bonds not only failed to  protect portfolios from the equity sell-off, but they  suffered their steepest losses in decades.   
 But better days lie ahead. We believe markets could  stabilize even as the economy worsens in 2023. The  global reset in valuations is presenting investors  with a broader range of viable options to help  achieve their goals.    
 Most importantly, we encourage you to focus on  your process: Define and revisit financial goals; then  design investment portfolios with the potential to  reach them.   
 Speak with your J.P. Morgan team to see how you  might turn that potential into your reality.

 IMPORTANT INFORMATION  
 Key Risks Past performance is no guarantee of future results. It is not possible to invest directly in an index. This material is for informational purposes only, and may inform you of certain products and services offered by private banking businesses of JPMorgan Chase & Co. (“JPM”). Products and services described, as well as associated fees, charges and interest rates, are subject to change in accordance with the applicable account agreements and may differ among geographic locations. Investing in fixed income products is subject to certain risks, including interest rate, credit, inflation, call, prepayment and reinvestment risk. Not all products and services are offered at all locations. If you are a person with a disability and need additional support accessing this material, please contact your J.P. Morgan team or email us at accessibility.support@jpmorgan.com for assistance. Please read all Important Information.  
 Alternative Investments Investment in alternative investment strategies is speculative, often involves a greater degree of risk than traditional investments including limited liquidity and limited transparency, among other factors and should only be considered by sophisticated investors with the financial capability to accept the loss of all or part of the assets devoted to such strategies.  
 Bonds Bonds are subject to interest rate risk, credit and default risk of the issuer. Bond prices generally fall when interest rates rise.  
 Commodities Investments in commodities may have greater volatility than investments in traditional securities. The value of commodities may be affected by changes in overall market movements, commodity index volatility, changes in interest rates, or factors affecting a particular industry or commodity, such as drought, floods, weather, livestock disease, embargoes, tariffs and international economic, political and regulatory developments. Investing in commodities creates an opportunity for increased return but, at the same time, creates the possibility for greater loss.  
 Equities The price of equity securities may rise or fall due to the changes in the broad market or changes in a company's financial condition, sometimes rapidly or unpredictably. Equity securities are subject to ""stock market risk"" meaning that stock prices in general may decline over short or extended periods of time. Preferred investments share characteristics of both stocks and bonds. Preferred securities are typically long dated securities with call protection that fall in between debt and equity in the capital structure. Preferred securities carry various risks and considerations which include: concentration risk; interest rate risk; lower credit ratings than individual bonds; a lower claim to assets than a firm's individual bonds; higher yields due to these risk characteristics; and “callable” implications meaning the issuing company may redeem the stock at a certain price after a certain date. Small capitalization companies typically carry more risk than well-established ""blue-chip"" companies since smaller companies can carry a higher degree of market volatility than most large cap and/or blue-chip companies. Investment in alternative investment strategies is speculative, often involves a greater degree of risk than traditional investments including limited liquidity and limited transparency, among other factors and should only be considered by sophisticated investors with the financial capability to accept the loss of all or part of the assets devoted to such strategies.

 UNDERSTANDING LTCMAS JPMAM Long-Term Capital Market Assumptions (LTCMAs): Given the complex risk-reward trade-offs involved, we advise clients to rely on judgment as well as quantitative optimization approaches in setting strategic allocations. Please note that all information shown is based on qualitative analysis.  
 Exclusive reliance on the above is not advised. This information is not  intended as a recommendation to invest in any particular asset class or  strategy or as a promise of future performance. Note that these asset class  and strategy assumptions are passive only – they do not consider the impact  of active management. References to future returns are not promises or  even estimates of actual returns a client portfolio may achieve. Assumptions,  opinions and estimates are provided for illustrative purposes only. They  should not be relied upon as recommendations to buy or sell securities.  Forecasts of financial market trends that are based on current market  conditions constitute our judgment and are subject to change without notice.  We believe the information provided here is reliable, but do not warrant its  accuracy or completeness. This material has been prepared for information  purposes only and is not intended to provide, and should not be relied on for,  accounting, legal or tax advice. The outputs of the assumptions are provided for  illustration/discussion purposes only and are subject to significant limitations.  “Expected” or “alpha” return estimates are subject to uncertainty and error.  For example, changes in the historical data from which it is estimated will  result in different implications for asset class returns. Expected returns for  each asset class are conditional on an economic scenario; actual returns in  the event the scenario comes to pass could be higher or lower, as they have  been in the past, so an investor should not expect to achieve returns similar  to the outputs shown herein. References to future returns for either asset  allocation strategies or asset classes are not promises of actual returns a  client portfolio may achieve. Because of the inherent limitations of all models,  potential investors should not rely exclusively on the model when making a  decision. The model cannot account for the impact that economic, market,  and other factors may have on the implementation and ongoing management  of an actual investment portfolio. Unlike actual portfolio outcomes, the model  outcomes do not reflect actual trading, liquidity constraints, fees, expenses,  taxes and other factors that could impact the future returns. The model  assumptions are passive only – they do not consider the impact of active  management. A manager’s ability to achieve similar outcomes is subject to  risk factors over which the manager may have no or limited control. The  views contained herein are not to be taken as advice or a recommendation  to buy or sell any investment in any jurisdiction, nor is it a commitment from  J.P.

 IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR INVESTMENTS AND POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST  
 Conflicts of interest will arise whenever JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. or  any of its affiliates (together, “J.P. Morgan”) have an actual or perceived  economic or other incentive in its management of our clients’ portfolios  to act in a way that benefits J.P. Morgan. Conflicts will result, for example  (to the extent the following activities are permitted in your account): (1)  when J.P. Morgan invests in an investment product, such as a mutual fund,  structured product, separately managed account or hedge fund issued   or managed by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. or an affiliate, such as   J.P. Morgan Investment Management Inc.; (2) when a J.P. Morgan entity  obtains services, including trade execution and trade clearing, from an  affiliate; (3) when J.P. Morgan receives payment as a result of purchasing  an investment product for a client’s account; or (4) when J.P. Morgan  receives payment for providing services (including shareholder servicing,  recordkeeping or custody) with respect to investment products purchased  for a client’s portfolio. Other conflicts will result because of relationships  that J.P. Morgan has with other clients or when J.P. Morgan acts for its   own account.   
 Investment strategies are selected from both J.P. Morgan and third-party asset managers and are subject to a review process by our manager research teams. From this pool of strategies, our portfolio construction teams select those strategies we believe fit our asset allocation goals and forward-looking views in order to meet the portfolio’s investment objective.  
 As a general matter, we prefer J.P. Morgan managed strategies. We expect the proportion of J.P. Morgan managed strategies will be high (in fact, up to 100 percent) in strategies such as, for example, cash and high-quality fixed income, subject to applicable law and any account-specific considerations.  
 While our internally managed strategies generally align well with our forward-looking views, and we are familiar with the investment processes as well as the risk and compliance philosophy of the firm, it is important to note that J.P. Morgan receives more overall fees when internally managed strategies are included. We offer the option of choosing to exclude J.P. Morgan managed strategies (other than cash and liquidity products) in certain portfolios.

 FX Snapshot 
 NZD Citi views & strategy Bias/ Forecasts/ Key levels 
 Citi FX outlook 
 We are bearish NZDUSD in 0-3m, and bullish 6- 12m. NZDUSD remains strongly driven by global risk sentiment and China dynamics. These drivers should be a drag vs USD in Q1’23, but tailwinds in the medium term. We are bullish on NZD for the coming 6-12m. Firstly, a more positive backdrop for risk assets alongside a softer USD is bullish the pair. Secondly, an eventual end to China’s zero-Covid policy may be supportive for both AUD and NZD. 
 Previously  • NZDUSD: 0 – 3mths: 0.54 
 • NZDUSD: 6 – 12mths: 0.58 
 • NZDUSD: Longer term: 0.67 
 Currently (as of Nov):  • NZDUSD: 0 – 3mths: 0.60 
 • NZDUSD: 6 – 12mths: 0.66 
 • NZDUSD: Longer term: 0.67 
 • 6-12mths: Moderately bullish NZD vs USD, bearish vs EUR 
 CAD Citi views & strategy Bias/ Forecasts/ Key levels 
 Citi FX outlook 
 USDCAD, like the rest of G10, has been an equity trade in disguise all year, and this dynamic is unlikely to change any time soon which means further near term CAD weakness, assuming a negative equity view materializes. CAD gains may be capped as BoC likely pivots dovish earlier than the Fed. This may see CAD underperform its peers and low yielders. For now, the better CAD positive strategies remain vs vulnerable euro bloc currencies (EUR and GBP). 
 Previously  • USDCAD: 0 – 3mth: 1.40 
 • USDCAD: 6 – 12mth: 1.31 
 • USDCAD: LT: 1.25 
 Currently (as of Nov):  • USDCAD: 0 – 3mth: 1.40 
 • USDCAD: 6 – 12mth: 1.25 
 • USDCAD: LT: 1.25 
 • 6-12mths: Bullish CAD vs USD, moderately bearish vs EUR 
 Commodity Blocs 
 AUD Citi views & strategy Bias/ Forecasts/ Key levels 
 Citi FX outlook 
 We are bearish AUDUSD into the start of 2023, predicated on a negative outlook for risk assets in Q1’23. Over the medium term, a possible extended tightening cycle by the RBA, a clearer outlook for the Chinese recovery that helps support commodity prices and cushions AUD from the impact from a US and European recession, should prove more supportive for AUD almost across the board. 
 Previously  • AUDUSD: 0 3mths: 0.60 
 • AUDUSD: 6 12mths: 0.65 
 • AUDUSD: LT: 0.76 
 Currently (as of Nov):  • AUDUSD: 0 3mths: 0.64 
 • AUDUSD: 6 12mths: 0.74

 Citi FX outlook 
 The Brexit remains a structural overhang for growth, via lower long run productivity, and external balances, via an impaired trade balance. Inbound UK M&A flows are weaker than levels suggested by the already poor global trend. Fears about UK’s fiscal sustainability recede somewhat (which likely means a higher floor in cable around the 1.10 1.12 area), but sterling remains a ‘sell on rallies’ against USD, the Commodity Bloc and SGD.

 Although economists say recession is inevitable, it may be milder and shorter than previously envisaged. Milder weather, lower gas prices, and fiscal support have lifted sentiment. Debt and equity capital flows from the US can find its way to Europe in 2023. China reopening is the big kicker and the Euro can be a big beneficiary. Downside risks for the Euro are periphery widening via ECB QT, a cold weather snap, and a souring of risk sentiment.

 CHF is likely to trade rangebound in the short term. On one hand, the Swiss economy is cooling, which would prompt the SNB to hike at a slower pace, following their 75 bp hike in September. However, this is offset by the outlook for a sell off in equities and a rally in duration. Overall, these forces balance each other out.

 Citi FX outlook 
 We forecast USD strength near term but expect material depreciation in the second half of 2023. We see USD performance split next year. For the first several months, we expect a resumption of risk asset underperformance, likely via the earnings channel for equities. This may keep the USD bid as there is still a strong inverse correlation between the USD and risk asset. Moving into the second half of 2023, the USD may enter into a depreciation regime. China may be exiting ZC policy and Europe may be starting to recover. RoW economic recovery tends to see USD depreciation.

 Even though capital controls were tightened a lot in early 2017, one scenario worth considering is that a China reopening may lead to a lot of capital outflow with negative effects on the RMB. Additionally, China reopening may lead to trade balance contraction. The PBoC has historically allowed the RMB to depreciate when the trade balance has fallen.

 Important Disclosure on High Yield Bonds  
 Unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities typically offer a higher yield than investment grade Debt Securities, but also present greater risks with respect to liquidity, volatility, and non-payment of principal and interest. As a result of being classified as non investment grade Debt Securities, these Debt Securities present a greater degree of credit risk relative to many other fixed income Debt Securities. Higher Credit Risk – Unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities generally have predominantly speculative characteristics with respect to the issuer’s capacity to pay interest and repay principal. There is greater risk of non-payment of interest and loss of principal. Many issuers of these Debt Securities have experienced substantial difficulties in servicing their debt obligations, which has led to default and restructurings. The issuers of these Debt Securities generally have to pay a higher rate of interest than investment grade Debt Securities. Higher Liquidity and Secondary Market Risk – The markets in which unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities are traded are generally more limited than those in which investment grade Debt Securities are traded. This lack of liquidity may make it more difficult to resell these Debt Securities and obtain market quotations. Downgrade Risk – Downgrades in the credit rating of unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities by rating agencies are generally accompanied by declines in the market value of these Debt Securities. In some circumstances, investors in the unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities market may anticipate such downgrades as a result of these credits being placed on “credit watch” by rating agencies, causing volatility and speculation of further credit deterioration. Higher Vulnerability to economic cycles - During economic downturns, unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities are typically more susceptible to price volatility and fall more in value than investment grade Debt Securities as i) investors may reevaluate holdings in lower-quality bonds in favor of investment-grade corporate Debt Securities; ii) investors become more risk averse; and iii) default risk rises.  This is often referred to a “flight to quality”. Event Risk – This includes any of a variety of events that can adversely affect the issuer of unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities, and therefore the issuer’s ability to meet debt service obligations to repay principal and interest to Debt Securities holders. Event risk may pertain to the issuer specifically, the industry or business sector of the issuer, or generally upon the overall economy. It could have a direct or indirect impact on the issuer and their outstanding debts. 
 Important Disclosure on RMB 
 Risk relating to RMB – If you choose RMB as the base currency or the alternate currency, you should also note the following: RMB is currently not freely convertible through banks in Hong Kong. Due to exchange controls and/or restrictions imposed on the convertibility, utilization or transferability of RMB (if any) which in turn is affected by, amongst other things, the PRC government's control, there is no guarantee that disruption in the transferability, convertibility or liquidity of RMB will not occur. There is thus a likelihood that you may not be able to convert RMB received into other freely convertible currencies. CNH exchange rates and CNY exchange rates are currently quoted in different markets with different exchange rates, whereby their exchange rate movements may not be in the same direction or magnitude. Therefore, the CNH exchange rate may be different from the CNY exchange rate.

 POLICY PICTURE 
 The Fed appears to have concluded the “expeditious” phase of its tightening cycle, delivering a 75bps rate hike to take the policy rate to their own neutral estimate of 2.25- 2.5%. Markets responded favourably in anticipation of a slower pace of tightening ahead (see Chart) given a loss of growth momentum, emerging signs of easing inflation pressures and the Fed’s emphasis on data dependence going forward (see quote).  
 Overall, we think the outlook for Fed policy has turned more balanced. We expect a further rate increase in September, with the hike increment being guided by key data releases such as the employment cost index, PCE inflation and measures of consumer inflation expectations. Thereafter, we think signs of softening in both the labour market and inflation outturns could see the Fed pause to assess the impact of this year’s rapid tightening. After all, the Fed has raised rates by 2.25% in just five months.   
 Notwithstanding the growing accumulation of evidence on weaker growth prospects for the second half of the year, policymakers appear to be retaining a glass-half-full assessment of the economy. During the post-meeting press conference Fed Chair Jerome Powell said he does not think the US is currently in recession as “there are just too many areas of the economy that are performing too well.” Meanwhile, US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen highlighted the creation of almost 400,000 jobs a month “is not a recession” and that a recession would require a “broad- based weakening of the economy” which is inconsistent with recent data.  
 Past performance does not guarantee future results, which may vary. The economic and market forecasts presented herein are for informational purposes as of the date of this presentation. There can be no assurance that the forecasts will be achieved. Please see additional disclosures at the end of this presentation.

 July 29, 2022 
 MACRO AT A GLANCE 
 Economic data has turned more mixed and is not consistently supportive of rapid monetary tightening. For example, flash composite PMI readings for July were in contractionary territory in the US and Euro Area (see Chart). Weakness on the services side of the economy likely reflects the cost-of-living crisis and indicates the post- Omicron rebound is behind us.  
 In Europe, high inflation continues to weigh on sentiment with the German ifo Business Climate index falling to its lowest level since June 2020. Meanwhile, the US economy experienced its second consecutive quarter of negative GDP growth. With nonfarm payroll growth averaging 375,000 during the second quarter and GDP data subject to revisions, we do not think the economy was in a recession in the first half of the year, however, we acknowledge risks are building.  
 NAVIGATING FIXED INCOME 
 A “bad news is good news” dynamic has emerged whereby signs of slowing growth and easing inflation pressures provides some relief for markets due to reduced risks of policy overtightening. That said, within fixed income sectors, bouts of weakness in lower-quality bonds reflects growing growth concerns (see Chart).  
 We used recent strength in high yield corporate credit as an opening to scale back our exposure. Overall, we remain overweight corporate bonds given continued strength in corporate balance sheet positions. However, we are mindful of downbeat signals from second quarter earnings releases, including signs of slowing consumer demand owing to inflation pressures.  
 Past performance does not guarantee future results, which may vary. The economic and market forecasts presented herein are for informational purposes as of the date of this presentation. There can be no assurance that the forecasts will be achieved. Please see additional disclosures at the end of this presentation.

 May 2022 (+50bps) 
 March 2022 (+25bps) 
 Started reducing the monthly pace of its net asset purchases in November 2021 and ended net additional purchases of Treasuries and agency MBS in early March. Balance sheet runoff begins in June; an eventual monthly cap will be set at $95bn—split $60bn-$35bn between US Treasury and mortgage- backed securities (MBS)—and the caps will initially be set at half of those levels for the first three months of runoff ($30bn UST-$17.5bn MBS). 
 Balance sheet size: 37% of GDP 
 We expect a 50bps rate hike in September followed by a reversion to 25bps rate hikes.  
 Slightly hawkish 
 ECB  Deposit facility rate: 0.0% 
 Last changed: July 2022 (+50bps), the first hike since 2011 
 The ECB will end net APP purchases from July 1, 2022. Reinvestments under the PEPP will continue until at least the end of 2024. On July 21, the ECB announced a new anti-fragmentation tool, the Transmission Protection Instrument (TPI), used to ensure monetary policy is transmitted smoothly across all euro area countries. Balance sheet size: 65% of GDP 
 We expect a 50bps hike in September and two further 25bps rate hikes at the October and December meetings.  
 Slightly dovish  
 BoE  Bank Rate: 1.25%  
 Last changed: June 2022 (+25bps) 
 Prior changes: 
 May 2022 (+25bps) March 2022 (+25bps) 
 February 2022 (+25bps) 
 December 2021 (+15bps) 
 BoE members voted in February 2022 to begin to reduce the stock of UK government bond purchases by ceasing to reinvest maturing assets, as well as to begin to reduce the stock of sterling non-financial investment grade corporate bond purchases by ceasing to reinvest maturing assets and by a program of corporate bond sales.  
 Balance sheet size: 30% of GDP 
 We think the BoE will hike rates further to 1.75% before pausing its hiking cycle.  
 We expect the BoE to commence bond sales at their September meeting.  
 Slightly dovish 
 BoJ  Policy deposit rate: -0.10%  
 Last changed: January 2016, when the Bank introduced its negative interest rate policy (NIRP)  
 10-year JGB yield target: ~0%, with tolerance band of - /+25bp (yield curve control policy) 
 The Bank voted in January 2021 to purchase ETFs and Japanese REITs as necessary with upper limits of ~¥12tn and ~¥180bn, respectively, on annual paces of increase in their outstanding amounts, as well as to purchase commercial paper and corporate bonds with an upper limit on the outstanding amount of ~¥20tn in total until the end of March. 
 Balance sheet size: 135% of GDP 
 We expect unchanged policies through 2022 but see scope for a rate hike in 2023. 
 Slightly dovish

These forecasts do not take into account the specific investment objectives, restrictions, tax and financial situation or other needs of any specific client.  Actual data will vary and may not be reflected here.  These forecasts are subject to high levels of uncertainty that may affect actual performance.

 FX Snapshot 
 NZD Citi views & strategy Bias/ Forecasts/ Key levels 
 Citi FX outlook 
 NZD outperformance earlier due to its higher carry looks unsustainable as –(1) current highly restrictive NZ financial conditions sharply raise the prospect of a hard landing for the NZ economy; (2) the recent larger 50bp hike sharply reduces odds of further RBNZ tightening; and (3) a strengthening Chinese recovery better supports other currencies closely linked to China (EUR, AUD, SGD, CNH). Against USD however, the combination of a stronger Chinese recovery in H2’23 and Fed pivoting towards rate cuts may yet lift NZDUSD in H2’23.

 CAD Citi views & strategy Bias/ Forecasts/ Key levels 
 Citi FX outlook 
 USDCAD may find it difficult to break below 1.30 – 32 support and that would almost certainly lead to CAD underperformance on non-USD crosses – versus EUR, SGD and AUD in particular, given their closer links to the Chinese recovery in a highly de-synchronized global business cycle this year. CAD is also likely to weaken vs JPY as BoJ moves to tighten financial conditions in Japan later this year.

 AUD Citi views & strategy Bias/ Forecasts/ Key levels 
 Citi FX outlook 
 Medium term the cyclical thesis for AUD remains supportive. The improving outlook for China’s economy, with stronger than expected credit expansion and trade data, points to government stimulus that may fuel investment. On terms of trade, Citi analysts remain neutral iron ore and bullish copper in the medium term, both positive AUD drivers. Combined with our EURUSD view of 1.16 in 6- 12m, this should feed into AUDUSD upside.

 GBP Citi views & strategy Bias/ Forecasts/ Key levels 
 Citi FX outlook 
 We still think that domestic fragilities in the UK remain in our forecast horizon, which brings on balance larger risk of growth and monetary policy divergences in favour of Europe. Bigger picture, the growth and CB dynamics are expected to align in a more bearish direction for GBP. Citi analysts expect a Q3 recession and November rate cut, earlier than any of the major DM economies.

 On growth, Citi analysts have pushed out their German recession forecast from Q4 2023 to Q4 2024, whereas Citi analysts have only pushed out their US recession forecast from Q3 to Q4 2023.

 CHF Citi views & strategy Bias/ Forecasts/ Key levels 
 Citi FX outlook 
 Room for more short-term hawkishness - domestic factors enable an incrementally hawkish SNB, which should keep CHF supported. SNB’s conditional inflation forecast would suggest the need for additional hikes, and the improvement in leading indicators creates room for a hawkish surprise.

 JPY Citi views & strategy Bias/ Forecasts/ Key levels 
 Citi FX outlook 
 BoJ YCC shift remains in play. Citi analysts’ base case is for shortening of the target duration from 10y to 5y or 3y in June meeting (after final outcome of spring wage negotiations). For US, as more hikes are priced, total cycle cuts are likely to deepen. Even in the scenario of a hawkish Fed, we think it may be hard for US duration to sell- off too much, but if things gets worse, it has a lot further to rally. This also makes JPY an asymmetric bet.

 USD Citi views & strategy Bias/ Forecasts/ Key levels 
 Citi FX outlook 
 USD signals almost uniformly bearish. Rates volatility has dropped sharply in recent weeks, triggering a more benign macro backdrop. Elsewhere, global growth dynamics are picking up (RoW LEIs 3m change turning positive from depressed levels), and US nominal rate momentum and data momentum is also negative vs G9. Finally, the USD is still historically overvalued, and a bull steepening US 2s10s curve is also the most bearish USD backdrop.

 Important Disclosure on High Yield Bonds  
 Unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities typically offer a higher yield than investment grade Debt Securities, but also present greater risks with respect to liquidity, volatility, and non-payment of principal and interest. As a result of being classified as non investment grade Debt Securities, these Debt Securities present a greater degree of credit risk relative to many other fixed income Debt Securities. Higher Credit Risk – Unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities generally have predominantly speculative characteristics with respect to the issuer’s capacity to pay interest and repay principal. There is greater risk of non-payment of interest and loss of principal. Many issuers of these Debt Securities have experienced substantial difficulties in servicing their debt obligations, which has led to default and restructurings. The issuers of these Debt Securities generally have to pay a higher rate of interest than investment grade Debt Securities. Higher Liquidity and Secondary Market Risk – The markets in which unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities are traded are generally more limited than those in which investment grade Debt Securities are traded. This lack of liquidity may make it more difficult to resell these Debt Securities and obtain market quotations. Downgrade Risk – Downgrades in the credit rating of unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities by rating agencies are generally accompanied by declines in the market value of these Debt Securities. In some circumstances, investors in the unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities market may anticipate such downgrades as a result of these credits being placed on “credit watch” by rating agencies, causing volatility and speculation of further credit deterioration. Higher Vulnerability to economic cycles - During economic downturns, unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities are typically more susceptible to price volatility and fall more in value than investment grade Debt Securities as i) investors may reevaluate holdings in lower-quality bonds in favor of investment-grade corporate Debt Securities; ii) investors become more risk averse; and iii) default risk rises.  This is often referred to a “flight to quality”. Event Risk – This includes any of a variety of events that can adversely affect the issuer of unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities, and therefore the issuer’s ability to meet debt service obligations to repay principal and interest to Debt Securities holders. Event risk may pertain to the issuer specifically, the industry or business sector of the issuer, or generally upon the overall economy. It could have a direct or indirect impact on the issuer and their outstanding debts. 
 Important Disclosure on RMB 
 Risk relating to RMB – If you choose RMB as the base currency or the alternate currency, you should also note the following: RMB is currently not freely convertible through banks in Hong Kong. Due to exchange controls and/or restrictions imposed on the convertibility, utilization or transferability of RMB (if any) which in turn is affected by, amongst other things, the PRC government's control, there is no guarantee that disruption in the transferability, convertibility or liquidity of RMB will not occur. There is thus a likelihood that you may not be able to convert RMB received into other freely convertible currencies. CNH exchange rates and CNY exchange rates are currently quoted in different markets with different exchange rates, whereby their exchange rate movements may not be in the same direction or magnitude. Therefore, the CNH exchange rate may be different from the CNY exchange rate.

 New Year, New USD Trend? 
 The bullish US Dollar theme eclipsed most of 2022, as the Federal Reserve tightened monetary policy at consecutive meetings, exiting the era of near zero interest rates. The new theme is that  of monetary policy convergence between the RoW and the US1.  The China reopening story; the shift away from “zero covid” policy is likely to be a key driver of macro appetite driving the broader reflation trade

 USD 
 The US Dollar has weakened by 3% since the end of November. In the view of Citi Analysts this is driven by convergence of monetary policy, a lower terminal rate for US yields and the China reopening story. 
 US inflation seems to have peaked, with a the primary contributor of energy costs having dropped dramatically vs 2022 highs. This has led to a tapering of expectations as to the terminal rate of the Federal Reserve base interest rate in this cycle, at a time where other central banks may need to continue to tighten. This view shift, if data points further inflationary pressures and/or the labour market becomes too tight, lifting wage costs materially. The most recent US Employment report printed continue growth in the labour market; 10 of the last 12 NFP releases have been surprised  to the upside2. 
 Citi Analysts hold the view of a slight rebound in the near-term of USD strength, with a broader  unwind in the second half 2022 as the macro drivers take hold3. The USD strength is to a lower  degree than previous forecasts, as other narratives such as the China reopening theme have arisen.

 EUR 
 The Euro has performed well over the past few weeks, driven by an unwind of the US Dollar, the China reopening theme, and slowing inflation in both the US and Europe. 
 The shift in Covid policy for China is a significant positive for the European economy4. The view  from Citi Analysts is that a normalization of Chinese demand, is supportive of the Euro-block; however, the caveat to this being that sudden shift from “zero covid”, creates the risk of sizeable waves of Covid. If this were to test healthcare capacity there could be a desire to reimpose  restrictions5, leading to an unwind in the positive euro sentiment. 
 The December ECB meeting provided a hawkish surprise and underpins the recent EUR/USD appreciation, as fears of sustained wage growth and core inflation have led to a repricing in terminal rate expectations for the Euro. Citi European economists are now forecasting the ECB to  hike by a further 3% from current levels6. 
 GBP 
 The backdrop for the UK economy remains challenging with the stagflation narrative ongoing. Inflationary fears have tapered following government intervention on energy prices, the warmer continental winter, and record levels of gas storage on the continent. UK Natural Gas Futures are  now below the levels of when Russian invaded Ukraine in Q1-227. 
 The backdrop of numerous strikes in multiple sectors over the cost of living, and the need for higher wages adds further pressure to the economy on the edge of a recession. As UK borrowing costs have lifted dramatically over the past 6 months, coinciding with a slowdown in the economy;  UK Mortgage Approvals are at a 29-month low8.

 Source: Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research (GIR) and Goldman Sachs Asset Management as of November 2022. The economic and market forecasts presented herein are for informational purposes as of the date of this presentation. There can be no assurance that the forecasts will be achieved. Goldman Sachs does not provide accounting, tax or legal advice. Please see additional disclosures at the end of this presentation.  Past performance does not guarantee future results, which may vary.  
 ASSET CLASS VIEWS¹ 
 1. ECONOMIC GROWTH:  On the heels of an aggressive tightening in financial conditions and restrictive monetary policy in 2022, GIR expects global growth to move below trend to 1.8% in 2023. Investors may be underestimating the resilience of the US economy, which contrasts with a mild recession in Europe and a bumpy reopening in China.  
 2. INFLATION:  Prices will likely slowly cool, with notable improvement in the policy-critical areas of shelter and wages. Supply chains have functioned better, with further improvements likely if China implements a more flexible COVID-19 strategy. Still, wage growth and long-term inflation expectations are likely key factors in forward monetary policy.  
 3. MONETARY POLICY:  Sticky inflation remains the preeminent global concern, locking central banks (CB) into a pause-over-pivot bias in 2023. Consequently, CBs are eager to nudge growth below potential. In the US, GIR expects a terminal rate of 5-5.25% and no cuts in 2023. In the Euro area and UK, terminal rates may reach 3.00% and 4.50%, respectively.  
 4. GEOPOLITICS:  Acute geopolitical dynamics remain present as ever, hallmarked by conflict in Ukraine, territorial flexing by China, and entrenched societal polarization. On the latter, we expect increasing uncertainty in government composition and policy. 
 5. DM EQUITY:  Rising cost of capital should accelerate the transition from highly bifurcated macro to deeply idiosyncratic drivers of return. To compete with compelling cross-asset opportunities, we believe a focus on profits over revenue, quality over capitalization, and company over country, is warranted. As current macro risks remain unresolved, a US equity tilt appears warranted, but the attractive cyclicality and potential FX tailwinds of non-US equities may emerge in 2023.  
 6. EM EQUITY:  EM equities face a challenging composition of subpar growth and a sharp tightening in financial conditions. However, we believe pockets of value may exist in EMs that are closer to relief from inflation and rates, including Brazil, Chile, and Korea. 
 7. RATES:  Global yields will likely move in tandem with CB policy paths, with potential differentiation due to regional energy exposure. GIR forecasts rates to top out in 1H 2023, though acknowledge the risk to the upside given policymakers’ willingness to overshoot. Globally, we believe the deepest level of curve inversion is behind us.  
 8. CREDIT:  Credit fundamentals have peaked but remain on solid footing. US corporates have room for additional spread widening, but disciplined capital management, a low wall of debt maturity, and cash-rich balance sheets may act as buffers. In Europe, uncertainty around policy and energy pose headwinds despite attractive valuations. 
 9. CURRENCY:  Near-term US dollar strength may persist as global growth risk is to the downside. Over the longer term, the US dollar looks vulnerable to high valuation and global recovery. Should the global growth-inflation mix improve, the USD is likely to rebate recent gains. 
 10. COMMODITIES:  Supply challenges are structural, based on years of underinvestment. While weakness may persist from factors such as higher real rates, USD strength, and recessionary concerns, longer-term physical tightness will not be easily resolved.

 MARKET PULSE: SPECIAL EDITION – 10 FOR 2023 
 Section Notes:  1 Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia,  2 International Labor Organization (ILO),  3 Transportation Security Administration (TSA),  4 Mortgage Bankers Association,  5 Bureau of Economic Analysis,  6 University of Michigan Survey of Consumers,  7,9 Goldman Sachs Asset Management,  8 Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research, and  9 Bloomberg. As of November 21, 2022, latest data available. Goldman Sachs does not provide accounting, tax or legal advice. The economic and market forecasts presented herein are for informational purposes as of the date of this document. There can be no assurance that the forecasts will be achieved.  Past performance does not guarantee future results, which may vary.  
 Point Break 
 We expect 2023 to be a year filled with macro inflection points as inflation and monetary policy pressures start to diminish. Alongside this transition, we believe investor prioritization of profitability over revenue and sticky income over the uncertainty of capital appreciation will be paramount. Market opportunities have already reset and investing next year may feature more of 1) stocks with durable cash flows, 2) quality bonds with significant coupons, and 3) alternatives with volatility-reducing attributes.  
 SUPPLY TIMELINES:  The share of manufacturing companies reporting faster supplier delivery times has increased 171% since the beginning of 2022 1 .  
 WORKING HOURS:  Global labor supply remains squeezed. The ILO estimates total work hours to stay 1.5% below pre-pandemic levels, equating to a deficit of 40mm full-time jobs 2 .   
 TRAVEL SURGE:  The daily number of passengers screened at TSA checkpoints has jumped by 17x relative to the pandemic low in 2020 3 .  
 HOME EQUITY:  Only 2% of US mortgages have negative equity today versus 25% in 2011 4 . Home prices would need to fall by 30% from 2021 levels to meaningfully erode loan- to-value ratios and increase strategic defaults.  
 CREDIT TRENDS:  While US loan delinquencies remain subdued, spending has rotated from discretionary to essential; top areas of credit acceleration—automotive parts, gas, and materials—have discouraged borrowing for recreation, clothing, and food services 5 . 
 BAD MOOD:  The UMichigan Consumer Sentiment Index printed below 60 in seven consecutive months, the longest stretch since inception as sticky costs diminish morale 6 .  
 SINGLE STOCK:  As of 3Q, 80% of S&P 500 companies have seen their equity prices fall at least 10% at some point this year, providing a large base for tax-loss harvesting 7 .  
 UP DOWN:  Performance swings have been more volatile this year relative to the long-term average. Positive days in 2022 have returned a daily average of 1.31% while negative days have posted an average drag of -1.14%, much wider than the historical bounds of +0.75% 7 .  
 TECH BREAK:  The market value loss for mega tech stocks this year is equivalent to the annual GDP of UK or France 8 .  
 YIELD LAGGARD:  A year ago, ~25% of global government debt offered negative nominal yields. Today, Japan is the last remaining sovereign borrower with negative-yielding debt, comprising <5% of all government debt 8 . 
 COST BENEFIT:  Rate volatility has exceeded the 90th percentile relative to the past ten years. Still, US Treasuries are yielding 5.5x more per unit of volatility than US stocks 8 .  
 DURATION LIMITS:  The risk and cost of a rate shock are lower and less punitive today relative to earlier this year. While a 100 bp rate shock may drag the Bloomberg US Aggregate Bond Index by -6.2%, a coupon offset of 2.7% may ultimately limit left-tail risks 9 .

 Risk Considerations 
 Equity securities are more volatile than bonds and subject to greater risks. Foreign and emerging markets investments may be more volatile and less liquid than investments in U.S. securities and are subject to the risks of currency fluctuations and adverse economic or political developments. Investments in commodities may be affected by changes in overall market movements, commodity index volatility, changes in interest rates or factors affecting a particular industry or commodity. The currency market affords investors a substantial degree of leverage. This leverage presents the potential for substantial profits but also entails a high degree of risk including the risk that losses may be similarly substantial. Currency fluctuations will also affect the value of an investment. 
 Investments in fixed income securities are subject to the risks associated with debt securities generally, including credit, liquidity, interest rate, call and extension risk. 
 A 10-Year Treasury is a debt obligation backed by the United States government and its interest payments are exempt from state and local taxes. However, interest payments are not exempt from federal taxes.  
 The above are not an exhaustive list of potential risks. There may be additional risks that should be considered before any investment decision.

 Global growth slowed through 2022 on a diminishing reopening boost, fiscal and n 
 monetary tightening, China’s Covid restrictions and property slump, and the Russia-Ukraine war.  We expect global growth of just 1.8% in 2023, as US resilience contrasts with a European recession and a bumpy reopening in China. 
 The US should narrowly avoid recession as core PCE inflation slows from 5% n 
 now to 3% in late 2023 with a ½pp rise in the unemployment rate.  To keep 
 growth below potential amidst stronger real income growth, we now see the Fed hiking another 125bp to a peak of 5-5.25%.  We don’t expect cuts in 2023. 
 How can core inflation fall so much with such a small employment hit?  The n 
 reason, we think, is that this cycle is different from prior high-inflation periods. First, post-pandemic labor market overheating showed up not in excessive employment but in unprecedented job openings, which are much less painful to unwind.  Second, the disinflationary impact of the recent normalization in supply chains and rental housing markets still has a long way to go.  And third, long-term inflation expectations remain well-anchored. 
 The Euro area and the UK are probably in recession, mainly because of the real n 
 income hit from surging energy bills.  But we expect only a mild downturn as Europe has already managed to cut Russian gas imports without crushing activity and is likely to benefit from the same post-pandemic improvements that are helping avoid US recession.  Given reduced risks of a deep downturn and persistent inflation, we now expect hikes through May with a 3% ECB peak. 
 China is likely to grow slowly in H1 as an April reopening initially triggers an n 
 increase in Covid cases that keeps caution high, but should accelerate sharply in H2 on a reopening boost.  Our longer-run China view remains cautious because of the long slide in the property market as well as slower potential growth (reflecting weakness in both demographics and productivity). 
 Several central banks in Central/Eastern Europe and Latin America started hiking n 
 rates well before their DM peers.  While none has clearly achieved a soft landing yet, activity has been resilient and inflation is now coming down in some countries, especially Brazil.  CEE is in a more difficult position because of its commodity exposure, high inflation, and ongoing monetary tightening.

 Global growth slowed sharply through 2022 on a diminishing reopening boost, fiscal and monetary tightening, China’s ongoing Covid restrictions and property slump, and the energy supply shock resulting from the Russia-Ukraine war.  We expect the world to continue growing at a below-trend pace of 1.8% in 2023, with a mild recession in Europe and a bumpy reopening in China but also important pockets of resilience in the US and some EM early hikers, such as Brazil.

 US Likely to Avoid Recession  In the past year, US growth has slowed to a below-potential pace of about 1% because of a diminishing reopening boost, declining real disposable income (driven by fiscal normalization and high inflation), and aggressive monetary tightening.  In our forecast, growth remains at roughly this pace in 2023.  Unlike a year ago, when our forecast for both 2022 and 2023 was below consensus because we expected a negative impact of monetary and especially fiscal tightening, our current 2023 forecast is well above consensus (Exhibit 2).    
 Our disagreement with the consensus is even more visible when we focus on recession probabilities.  As shown in Exhibit 3, we estimate a 35% probability that the US economy enters recession over the next 12 months, well below the median of 65% among the forecasters in the latest Wall Street Journal survey and toward the bottom of the range.

 Why is our recession probability—while more than twice as high as the unconditional probability of entering recession in any given 12-month period—still clearly below 50%? One immediate reason is that the incoming activity data are nowhere close to recessionary.  The advance GDP report showed 2.6% (annualized) growth in Q3, nonfarm payrolls grew 261k in October, and there were 225k initial jobless claims in the week of November 5.   
 More fundamentally, there are strong reasons to expect positive growth in coming quarters.  To be sure, the tightening in financial conditions is weighing heavily on growth, to the tune of nearly 2pp at present.  But real disposable personal income is rebounding from the plunge seen in H1—when fiscal tightening and sharply higher inflation took their toll—to a pace of 3%+over the next year (Exhibit 4).  And while there are risks on both sides, we think the real income upturn is likely to be the stronger force as we move through 2023, especially because the financial conditions drag will likely diminish assuming Fed officials do not deliver dramatically more tightening than the rates market is currently pricing.

 But the most fundamental question is this: how can the Fed bring down inflation by 2 percentage points over the next year with only a ½pp increase in the unemployment rate (Exhibit 5)?  Doesn’t this fly in the face of the experience from prior high-inflation episodes—most notably the 1970s—that ended with a much bigger increase in unemployment?  
 Our answer is that this cycle is different from prior high-inflation periods.   
 The first reason why this cycle is different is that post-pandemic labor market overheating showed up not in excessive employment but in unprecedented job openings.  As shown in Exhibit 6, job openings surged in 2020-2021 as employers sought to keep up with the strongest economic recovery on record amidst continuing Covid fears and exceptionally generous unemployment benefits.  However, employment as a share of the labor force only rose to roughly the pre-pandemic level, not above.

 Now, however, the environment looks very different.  Demand has slowed, the pandemic has subsided, unemployment benefits have normalized, and excess savings are coming down.  It is therefore not surprising that job openings and our jobs-workers gap—total labor demand minus total labor supply—are coming down quickly.  Based on timely job openings measures from Linkup and Indeed, we estimate that the jobs-workers gap has declined from a peak of nearly 6 million to just over 4 million, nearly half of the way to the 2mn level required to slow wage growth to a rate compatible with the inflation target (Exhibit 7, left panel).  Partly because of the reduction in the jobs-workers gap, timely measures of nominal wage growth, i.e. composition-adjusted average hourly earnings and our monthly wage survey composite,  
 have slowed to levels consistent with 4½% wage growth (Exhibit 7, right panel).

 The second reason why this cycle is different is that the recent normalization in supply chains and rental housing markets is a source of disinflation not seen in previous high-inflation episodes such as the 1970s, and it is only beginning to show up in the official numbers (Exhibit 8).  On the goods side, the ongoing rotation from goods to services spending, healing supply chains, and rebounding inventory levels should put downward pressure on core goods prices.  On the services side, asking rents on new leases have decelerated sharply after the one-time jump in rents related to the work from home-related increase in demand for space.  The October CPI report suggests that the lagging measure of sequential monthly official CPI shelter inflation—which captures both new and continuing leases—has likely peaked too.  Although year-on-year shelter inflation will likely rise through next spring as rents on continuing leases catch up to higher market rates, it is set to slow thereafter.

 The third reason is that long-term inflation expectations remain well-anchored, especially relative to the 1970s.  This is true for each of the available measures, namely those based on 1) surveys of households, 2) surveys of economic forecasters, and 3) inflation-protected bonds.  Measures of short-term inflation expectations remain relatively high, but much of this probably reflects the spike in commodity prices and should wane if commodity prices level off.  The fact that inflation has only been high for a short and unusual pandemic period also suggests that elevated inflation is not entrenched (Exhibit 9).  
 Taken together, we expect year-over-year core PCE inflation to decline from 5.1% in September to 2.9% in December 2023  (Exhibit 10).  We expect supply-constrained durable goods with still elevated margins, such as used cars, to drive nearly half of the slowdown in overall core inflation.

 One might assume that our relatively optimistic inflation forecast translates into a relatively dovish Fed call.  But that assumption would be wrong.  The reason comes back to the interplay between real income and financial conditions.  As real income recovers, a negative FCI growth impulse is required to keep growth below potential and continue rebalancing the labor market.  However, the negative FCI impulse on sequential growth will likely diminish from its current drag of around 2pp annualized because it depends on the change in, rather than the level of, financial conditions (Exhibit 4, right panel).  As a result, and even under our relatively optimistic inflation forecast, additional rate hikes of at least as much as markets are now pricing are likely required to keep the labor market adjustment going.  Following the FCI easing over the past month, we now expect an additional 125bp of Fed rate hikes (vs. 100bp previously)  
 with a downshift in the hiking pace to 50bp in December, and three smaller 25bp hikes in February, March, and now also May.  Our new 5-5.25% peak funds rate is modestly above market pricing (Exhibit 11).

 With a resilient labor market and still elevated inflation, we don’t see any rate cuts in 2023 unless the economy enters recession after all.  In our no-recession forecast, the Fed only implements a first gentle 25bp cut in 2024Q2.  This baseline of “high rates for longer” would again illustrate how different this cycle is as the first Fed cut in the median hiking cycle has historically come roughly six months after the last hike.

 A Mild Recession in Europe  In contrast to the US, the Euro area and the UK are probably in recession.  The reason for this is the much bigger and more drawn-out increase in household energy bills, which should boost headline inflation to peaks of 12% in the Euro area and 11% in the UK, far higher than in the US (Exhibit 12, left panel).   
 In turn, high inflation is set to weigh on real income, consumption, and industrial production.  We forecast further declines in real income of 1½% in the Euro area through 2023Q1 and 3% in the UK through 2023Q2, before a pickup in H2 (Exhibit 12, right panel).  The plunge in timely and forward-looking surveys of gas-intensive European industries such as chemicals and metals also suggests that rising energy costs will lower production (Exhibit 13).  As a result, we look for cumulative declines in real GDP of 0.7% in the Euro area (2022Q4-2023Q2) and 1.7% in the UK (2022Q3-2023Q2).

 Exhibit 13: Surveys of Gas-Intensive European Industries Have Plunged  
 Source: Haver Analytics, Eurostat, Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research 
 However, we don’t expect a deep European downturn, barring a very cold winter that imposes more severe energy rationing on the industrial sector in order to keep people warm in their homes.  
 Already, Europe has cut Russian gas imports by 80% and total gas consumption by 20-25% without crushing aggregate activity.  In fact, most of the hard economic data (as opposed to the surveys) continue to hold up remarkably well so far, with industrial production moving sideways, real GDP still up in the Euro area in Q3 (though down  
 slightly in the UK), and labor markets holding up so far. 
 We think the reason for this resilience is that household energy savings and substitution to other energy sources have helped absorb the collapse in Russian gas imports.  Along with mild weather, these savings have boosted gas storage, reduced TTF gas prices by 60% from their peak, and reduced downside risk from a very cold winter.  
 Moreover, Europe is likely to benefit from three similar post-pandemic sources of resilience that are helping the US avoid recession altogether.  First, Exhibit 14 shows that the rise in German production of chip-intensive items and cars—where pandemic bottlenecks are still easing—has approximately offset the ongoing decline in energy-intensive production.

 Second, any decline in the household saving rate would support consumer spending, as happened in the US when real income plunged in early 2022.  Exhibit 15 points to room in Europe for saving rates to fall and for consumer credit growth to pick up (although likely by less than in the US because European lower-income households have relatively limited excess savings).  Third, while the bulk of reopening gains are behind us, Europe is still benefiting somewhat from a rebound in the service sector.    
 While near-term risks of a deep recession have receded somewhat and our commodity strategists now look for a more limited rise in European gas prices next summer, we don’t expect GDP to rebound sharply in Europe once it exits a mild recession.  The main reason is that energy prices will likely stay high until sufficient new energy supply and/or

 major efficiency gains materialize.  Moreover, fiscal policy turns should turn into a drag from the second half of 2023 onwards.    
 Incorporating both the resilience in incoming hard data and our less elevated path for gas prices, we have nudged up our Euro area 2023 growth forecast to -0.1% (from -0.4% previously). 
 What about European core inflation?  Although commodities drove the initial headline surge, price pressures have broadened significantly across core categories in both the Euro area and the UK following upside inflation surprises (Exhibit 16, left panel).  In fact, UK core price pressures are now the broadest across the G10, with a perfect storm of an energy crisis (like continental Europe) and an overheated labor market (like the US).   
 Given this strong momentum, we expect Euro area core inflation to edge up further to a peak of 5.3% year-over-year in December, before gradually declining to just above 3% by end-2023 on goods disinflation.  In the UK, we think that core inflation is peaking right around now and will also decline to 3% by end-2023.   
 Given reduced risks of deep recession and persistent inflationary pressures, we now expect the ECB to hike through May with an additional 150bp of rate hikes to a peak deposit rate of 3% (vs. 2.75% previously).  Along with the reduction in near-term headline inflation pressures from gas prices, the emphasis on substantial rate hikes so far increases our conviction that the ECB will step down the pace to 50bp in December, in parallel with the Fed.  We maintain our forecast for a second 50bp hike in February but, given the firmer demand outlook, now look for two additional smaller 25bp hikes at the March and May meetings.  The risks around our peak 3% ECB rate are two-sided, with upside risk from potentially more persistent core inflation and downside risk from a deeper recession or a possible flare-up in sovereign risk in Italy.  Given the tight labor market, high wage pressures, and firm inflation, we expect the BoE to hike Bank Rate by an additional 150bp to a terminal rate of 4.5%.

 China’s Bumpy Reopening  Our 2023 China outlook is a story of two halves with slow growth in the first half followed by a more pronounced rebound in the second half as the economy reopens (Exhibit 17).   
 We expect weak growth in Q4 and Q1 as the Zero Covid Policy (ZCP) likely stays in place during the winter.  In fact, the recent sharp rise in cases led us to have a significantly below-consensus Q4 estimate of 1.2% annualized.

 Although the leadership has clearly signaled that it aims to exit ZCP, we do not expect actual reopening to start until April.  The basic reason for this is that medical and communication preparations will take time.  Less than 70% of the 60+ age group in Mainland China are triple-vaccinated (Exhibit 18), and data from Hong Kong show that the unvaccinated elderly remain at serious risk of severe outcomes.  As a result, China will need to significantly ramp up its vaccination pace from the current 100k/day before reopening can safely begin.

 Despite our April reopening baseline, we forecast Q2 growth of just 2% annualized on our assumption that reopening initially triggers an increase in infections that keeps caution high.  Weak growth in East Asian economies such as South Korea, Taiwan, and Hong Kong during the first quarter of exiting ZCP also supports our soft Q2 forecast.    
 In contrast, we look for a meaningful reopening growth boost in H2, which will likely extend into 2024.  As ZCP is currently still subtracting about 4-5% from the level of GDP, we see substantial room for a cyclical rebound as immunity levels rise and most households learn to live with the virus.    
 Although clearly above consensus, our Q3 and Q4 forecasts of 10% and 6% annualized are not spectacular relative to other international reopening experiences.  This is because we expect a continued drag from Covid caution as well as other headwinds, some cyclical and some more structural.   
 On the cyclical side, fiscal policy is set to tighten if the domestic economy rebounds, and China’s pandemic-related export boom should fade as global demand for tech, housing, and Covid-related products slows further.   
 On the structural side, we see the contraction of the property sector and US chip export restrictions as multi-year drags.  We estimate that the ongoing slide of the property sector will subtract around -1½pp from growth next year as it continues to delever and face demographic headwinds (Exhibit 19).

 We recently also estimated that the new US restrictions on exports of advanced chips (and the equipment and software to produce them) to China will subtract about ¼pp from China growth next year and 1.7% from the 2026 level of GDP, assuming US policymakers are serious about implementation.  This reflects reduced production in China of both chips and goods using advanced chips, such as smartphones and computers.   
 The relatively muted rebound in aggregate demand—coupled with the relatively limited rise in inflation during reopening in other Asian economies—also drives our benign forecast for 2023 inflation and monetary policy.  Specifically, we expect core CPI to pick up only slightly from 0.7% to 1.2% next year, and the policy rate to stay flat at just 2%.   
 Although we do see a sharper reopening boost in 2023H2 and 2024H1 than other forecasters, our long-run China views remain structurally below consensus (Exhibit 20).  We estimate that much of the slowdown in actual China growth in recent years corresponds to a slowdown in potential growth to only 4.2% in 2023.  We estimate that trend growth will slow further to just above 3% over the next decade on weakness in both demographics and productivity, and the long slide in the property market.

 Pockets of Resilience in EM Early Hikers  
 A number of economies in Latin America as well as Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) started hiking rates well before everyone else.  Among the nine EM early hikers, the policy rate has increased by an average of over 800bp (Exhibit 21, left panel) while our GS Financial Conditions Index (FCI) has tightened by an average of 450bp. 1   Where are these economies headed and what can we learn from their experience for the broader global outlook?  
 While no early hiker has clearly achieved a soft landing yet, activity has generally held up better than expected.  A majority of early hikers are probably still expanding, based on GDP growth, PMIs, and labor market indicators.  In particular, unemployment rates remain low in all economies, although they have edged up in several economies (Exhibit 21, right panel). 2   We have found that elevated job openings, reopening, and strong private sector balance sheets—again unique characteristics of this different cycle—help explain this resilience.  
 Encouragingly, sequential core inflation and wage growth have begun to moderate across most early hikers, although they remain very high.  The moderation in core inflation is most notable in Brazil, where we expect rate cuts to start in 2023Q2 and growth to pick up back to a potential-like pace of 2% in the second half of the year (Exhibit 22, left panel).    
 In contrast, the CEE economies are in a more difficult position.  This reflects CEE’s exposure to the surge in European gas prices, as well as continued high, broad, and in the cases of Hungary and Poland still-rising inflation.  We therefore expect the Czech and Polish central banks to resume their rate hike campaigns before long (Exhibit 22,  
 1 We define an “early hiker” as a country under our coverage that began to increase the policy rate by  
 October 2021 with a cumulative increase in the first six months of at least 100bp. 
 2 Our classification suggests that Chile is likely in a mild recession, while the Czech Republic and Poland are  
 close calls.

 right panel), and look for moderate declines in GDP in most CEE economies.  
 Overall, the resilience of activity in several EM early hikers so far supports our view that the current high-inflation period does not need to end in deep recession.    
 Some Progress, But Still an Uncertain World  The key economic question for 2023 is whether central banks will be able to bring down inflation to more acceptable levels without a recession, or at least without a deep recession.  We are reasonably optimistic, but there are substantial risks to our view.  
 One risk is that inflation pressures simply remain pervasive enough that central banks have no choice but to keep tightening aggressively.  If so, a recession might become unavoidable, not just in Europe but also in the US.  The recent news flow has reduced this risk slightly in the US, as the labor market continues to adjust and inflation has begun to slow.  But the picture is not uniform.  Central banks in Europe and those EM economies where inflation is still increasing may be forced into further tightening in an environment of exchange rate depreciation and rising inflation expectations.  
 The other main risk is that underlying inflation does come down, but central banks are late in recognizing the improvement because they are too focused on lagging indicators of inflation such as CPI shelter inflation.  In the US, we have recently become a little less concerned about this risk as well.  Fed officials have made it clear that they are not exclusively focused on the CPI rent numbers but also on more leading indicators such as asking rents on new leases, which have slowed sharply in recent months.  Moreover, many central banks have either already slowed their hiking pace or signaled that they will do so soon.  This reduces the risk of overtightening as it will allow for more time to assess the impact of higher rates on the economy.  
 Beyond the core inflation dynamic, we remain concerned about political and geopolitical

 shocks, which could affect the global economy via higher uncertainty, tighter financial conditions, or negative effects on commodity supply.  Some of these risks have diminished slightly as well.  The Italian, Brazilian, and US midterm elections have come and gone without major market disruptions.  Spreads on Italian government debt have diminished, Brazil may be headed toward a soft landing, and there is even a possibility that the US debt limit—arguably the biggest potential source of market disruption emanating from DC in 2023—will be resolved in the “lame-duck” session of Congress between now and year-end 2022.  Moreover, the latest meeting between Presidents Biden and Xi promises to defuse at least some of the tensions between the US and China, which might also help to achieve a negotiated solution to the Russia-Ukraine war.   
 But there are still plenty of risks that could return us to the exceptionally volatile environment of the first half of 2022.  So far, a settlement in the Russia-Ukraine war does not seem close at hand, and the impact of the price cap on Russian oil is uncertain.  The political instability in the Middle East—while far from a new feature of the geopolitical order—also has the potential to deal another blow to energy markets at a time when the supply-demand balance is already precarious.  Thus, our cautiously optimistic global economic outlook remains fraught with substantial risks.

 Citi FX outlook 
 NZDUSD remains mainly driven by China dynamics and global risk sentiment. If the NZ economy substantially slows down in H1’23 with the RBNZ hiking into economic weakness , the market will likely price a pivot earlier than the RBNZ signals it, weighing on NZD. As a result, AUD is likely to outperform NZD during the forecast horizon. A bullish view on NZD though may still be expressed on selective non USD crosses against GBP.

 In the short term, we see another leg higher in USDCAD as equity performance is likely to be rocky over the next three months following likely downward EPS revisions in the US. In the long term however, a weaker USD and a more positive environment for global equities may see USDCAD lower. However, we expect relative underperformance vs. other commodity exporters given structural ties to the US economy, where the base case is for a recession in H2 2023.

 On growth, the UK lags with the slowest recovery to pre pandemic levels of real GDP. Inbound M&A also remains weaker than the global trend which likely represents a loss of confidence in the future of UK’s business model in a post Brexit world. The sole main upside risk to GBP comes from global risk on via a US soft landing combining with Europe and China bottoming.

 Soft data in Europe has bottomed indicating a much shallower downturn in Europe than earlier feared. China reopening is the big kicker to the European outlook.

 There are a number of factors which may drive USD lower through 2023. First the US is expected to enter into recession, at a time where Europe may be recovering and China expected to have exited from ZC policy. USD performance is likely to be much more subdued (and mostly negative) in a US only recession. Second, when global leading indicators (ex US) turn higher, there is meaningful USD depreciation over the following 12 months. There is likely to be greater volatility in rates and FX over the current quarter that sees in DXY in a 100- 108.00 range. For H2’2023 however DXY may be back to 95.00-96.00.

 Important Disclosure on High Yield Bonds  
 Unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities typically offer a higher yield than investment grade Debt Securities, but also present greater risks with respect to liquidity, volatility, and non-payment of principal and interest. As a result of being classified as non investment grade Debt Securities, these Debt Securities present a greater degree of credit risk relative to many other fixed income Debt Securities. Higher Credit Risk – Unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities generally have predominantly speculative characteristics with respect to the issuer’s capacity to pay interest and repay principal. There is greater risk of non-payment of interest and loss of principal. Many issuers of these Debt Securities have experienced substantial difficulties in servicing their debt obligations, which has led to default and restructurings. The issuers of these Debt Securities generally have to pay a higher rate of interest than investment grade Debt Securities. Higher Liquidity and Secondary Market Risk – The markets in which unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities are traded are generally more limited than those in which investment grade Debt Securities are traded. This lack of liquidity may make it more difficult to resell these Debt Securities and obtain market quotations. Downgrade Risk – Downgrades in the credit rating of unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities by rating agencies are generally accompanied by declines in the market value of these Debt Securities. In some circumstances, investors in the unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities market may anticipate such downgrades as a result of these credits being placed on “credit watch” by rating agencies, causing volatility and speculation of further credit deterioration. Higher Vulnerability to economic cycles - During economic downturns, unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities are typically more susceptible to price volatility and fall more in value than investment grade Debt Securities as i) investors may reevaluate holdings in lower-quality bonds in favor of investment-grade corporate Debt Securities; ii) investors become more risk averse; and iii) default risk rises.  This is often referred to a “flight to quality”. Event Risk – This includes any of a variety of events that can adversely affect the issuer of unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities, and therefore the issuer’s ability to meet debt service obligations to repay principal and interest to Debt Securities holders. Event risk may pertain to the issuer specifically, the industry or business sector of the issuer, or generally upon the overall economy. It could have a direct or indirect impact on the issuer and their outstanding debts. 
 Important Disclosure on RMB 
 Risk relating to RMB – If you choose RMB as the base currency or the alternate currency, you should also note the following: RMB is currently not freely convertible through banks in Hong Kong. Due to exchange controls and/or restrictions imposed on the convertibility, utilization or transferability of RMB (if any) which in turn is affected by, amongst other things, the PRC government's control, there is no guarantee that disruption in the transferability, convertibility or liquidity of RMB will not occur. There is thus a likelihood that you may not be able to convert RMB received into other freely convertible currencies. CNH exchange rates and CNY exchange rates are currently quoted in different markets with different exchange rates, whereby their exchange rate movements may not be in the same direction or magnitude. Therefore, the CNH exchange rate may be different from the CNY exchange rate.

 NZD Citi views & strategy Bias/ Forecasts/ Key levels 
 Citi FX outlook 
 We are bearish NZDUSD in 0-3m, and bullish 6- 12m. NZDUSD remains strongly driven by global risk sentiment and China dynamics. These drivers should be a drag vs USD in Q1’23, but tailwinds in the medium term. We are bullish on NZD for the coming 6-12m. Firstly, a more positive backdrop for risk assets alongside a softer USD is bullish the pair. Secondly, an eventual end to China’s zero-Covid policy may be supportive for both AUD and NZD.

 Citi FX outlook 
 USDCAD, like the rest of G10, has been an equity trade in disguise all year, and this dynamic is unlikely to change any time soon which means further near term CAD weakness, assuming a negative equity view materializes. CAD gains may be capped as BoC likely pivots dovish earlier than the Fed. This may see CAD underperform its peers and low yielders. For now, the better CAD positive strategies remain vs vulnerable euro bloc currencies (EUR and GBP).

 The Brexit remains a structural overhang for growth, via lower long run productivity, and external balances, via an impaired trade balance. Inbound UK M&A flows are weaker than levels suggested by the already poor global trend. Fears about UK’s fiscal sustainability recede somewhat (which likely means a higher floor in cable around the 1.10 1.12 area), but sterling remains a ‘sell on rallies’ against USD, the Commodity Bloc and SGD.

 Although economists say recession is inevitable, it may be milder and shorter than previously envisaged. Milder weather, lower gas prices, and fiscal support have lifted sentiment. Debt and equity capital flows from the US can find its way to Europe in 2023. China reopening is the big kicker and the Euro can be a big beneficiary. Downside risks for the Euro are periphery widening via ECB QT, a cold weather snap, and a souring of risk sentiment.

 CHF is likely to trade rangebound in the short term. On one hand, the Swiss economy is cooling, which would prompt the SNB to hike at a slower pace, following their 75 bp hike in September. However, this is offset by the outlook for a sell off in equities and a rally in duration. Overall, these forces balance each other out.

 Citi FX outlook 
 We forecast USD strength near term but expect material depreciation in the second half of 2023. We see USD performance split next year. For the first several months, we expect a resumption of risk asset underperformance, likely via the earnings channel for equities. This may keep the USD bid as there is still a strong inverse correlation between the USD and risk asset. Moving into the second half of 2023, the USD may enter into a depreciation regime. China may be exiting ZC policy and Europe may be starting to recover. RoW economic recovery tends to see USD depreciation.

 Even though capital controls were tightened a lot in early 2017, one scenario worth considering is that a China reopening may lead to a lot of capital outflow with negative effects on the RMB. Additionally, China reopening may lead to trade balance contraction. The PBoC has historically allowed the RMB to depreciate when the trade balance has fallen.

 Important Disclosure on High Yield Bonds  
 Unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities typically offer a higher yield than investment grade Debt Securities, but also present greater risks with respect to liquidity, volatility, and non-payment of principal and interest. As a result of being classified as non investment grade Debt Securities, these Debt Securities present a greater degree of credit risk relative to many other fixed income Debt Securities. Higher Credit Risk – Unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities generally have predominantly speculative characteristics with respect to the issuer’s capacity to pay interest and repay principal. There is greater risk of non-payment of interest and loss of principal. Many issuers of these Debt Securities have experienced substantial difficulties in servicing their debt obligations, which has led to default and restructurings. The issuers of these Debt Securities generally have to pay a higher rate of interest than investment grade Debt Securities. Higher Liquidity and Secondary Market Risk – The markets in which unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities are traded are generally more limited than those in which investment grade Debt Securities are traded. This lack of liquidity may make it more difficult to resell these Debt Securities and obtain market quotations. Downgrade Risk – Downgrades in the credit rating of unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities by rating agencies are generally accompanied by declines in the market value of these Debt Securities. In some circumstances, investors in the unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities market may anticipate such downgrades as a result of these credits being placed on “credit watch” by rating agencies, causing volatility and speculation of further credit deterioration. Higher Vulnerability to economic cycles - During economic downturns, unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities are typically more susceptible to price volatility and fall more in value than investment grade Debt Securities as i) investors may reevaluate holdings in lower-quality bonds in favor of investment-grade corporate Debt Securities; ii) investors become more risk averse; and iii) default risk rises.  This is often referred to a “flight to quality”. Event Risk – This includes any of a variety of events that can adversely affect the issuer of unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities, and therefore the issuer’s ability to meet debt service obligations to repay principal and interest to Debt Securities holders. Event risk may pertain to the issuer specifically, the industry or business sector of the issuer, or generally upon the overall economy. It could have a direct or indirect impact on the issuer and their outstanding debts. 
 Important Disclosure on RMB 
 Risk relating to RMB – If you choose RMB as the base currency or the alternate currency, you should also note the following: RMB is currently not freely convertible through banks in Hong Kong. Due to exchange controls and/or restrictions imposed on the convertibility, utilization or transferability of RMB (if any) which in turn is affected by, amongst other things, the PRC government's control, there is no guarantee that disruption in the transferability, convertibility or liquidity of RMB will not occur. There is thus a likelihood that you may not be able to convert RMB received into other freely convertible currencies. CNH exchange rates and CNY exchange rates are currently quoted in different markets with different exchange rates, whereby their exchange rate movements may not be in the same direction or magnitude. Therefore, the CNH exchange rate may be different from the CNY exchange rate.

 Definitions: 
 Investing in  alternative assets  involves higher risks than traditional investments and is suitable only for sophisticated investors. Alternative investments involve greater risks than traditional investments and should not be deemed a complete investment program. They are not tax efficient and an investor should consult with his/her tax advisor prior to investing. Alternative investments have higher fees than traditional investments and they may also be highly leveraged and engage in speculative investment techniques, which can magnify the potential for investment loss or gain. The value of the investment may fall as well as rise and investors may get back less than they invested. 
 Bonds  are subject to interest rate risks. Bond prices generally fall when interest rates rise. 
 Investments in  commodities  may have greater volatility than investments in traditional securities, particularly if the instruments involve leverage. The value of commodity-linked derivative instruments may be affected by changes in overall market movements, commodity index volatility, changes in interest rates, or factors affecting a particular industry or commodity, such as drought, floods, weather, livestock disease, embargoes, tariffs and international economic, political and regulatory developments. Use of leveraged commodity-linked derivatives creates an opportunity for increased return but, at the same time, creates the possibility for greater loss. 
 Derivatives  may be riskier than other types of investments because they may be more sensitive to changes in economic or market conditions than other types of investments and could result in losses that significantly exceed the original investment. The use of derivatives may not be successful, resulting in investment losses, and the cost of such strategies may reduce investment returns.  
 Distressed Restructuring Strategies  employ an investment process focused on corporate fixed income instruments, primarily on corporate credit instruments of companies trading at significant discounts to their value at issuance or obliged (par value) at maturity as a result of either formal bankruptcy proceeding or financial market perception of near term proceedings. 
 Investments in  emerging markets  can be more volatile. The normal risks of investing in foreign countries are heightened when investing in emerging markets. In addition, the small size of securities markets and the low trading volume may lead to a lack of liquidity, which leads to increased volatility. Also, emerging markets may not provide adequate legal protection for private or foreign investment or private property. 
 The price of  equity  securities may rise, or fall because of changes in the broad market or changes in a company’s financial condition, sometimes rapidly or unpredictably. These price movements may result from factors affecting individual companies, sectors or industries, or the securities market as a whole, such as changes in economic or political conditions. Equity securities are subject to “stock market risk” meaning that stock prices in general may decline over short or extended periods of time. 
 Equity market neutral strategies  employ sophisticated quantitative techniques of analyzing price data to ascertain information about future price movement and relationships between securities, select securities for purchase and sale. Equity Market Neutral Strategies typically maintain characteristic net equity market exposure no greater than 10% long or short. 
 Global macro strategies  trade a broad range of strategies in which the investment process is predicated on movements in underlying economic variables and the impact these have on equity, fixed income, hard currency and commodity markets. 
 International  investing involves a greater degree of risk and increased volatility. Changes in currency exchange rates and differences in accounting and taxation policies outside the U.S. can raise or lower returns. Some overseas markets may not be as politically and economically stable as the United States and other nations. 
 There is no guarantee that the use of  long and short positions  will succeed in limiting an investor's exposure to domestic stock market movements, capitalization, sector swings or other risk factors. Using long and short selling strategies may have higher portfolio turnover rates. Short selling involves certain risks, including additional costs associated with covering short positions and a possibility of unlimited loss on certain short sale positions. 
 Merger arbitrage strategies  which employ an investment process primarily focused on opportunities in equity and equity related instruments of companies which are currently engaged in a corporate transaction. 
 Mid-capitalization  investing typically carries more risk than investing in well-established ""blue-chip"" companies. Historically, mid-cap companies' stock has experienced a greater degree of market volatility than the average stock. 
 Price to forward earnings  is a measure of the price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) using forecasted earnings.  Price to book value  compares a stock's market value to its book value.  Price to cash flow  is a measure of the market's expectations of a firm's future financial health.  Price to dividends  is the ratio of the price of a share on a stock exchange to the dividends per share paid in the previous year, used as a measure of a company's potential as an investment. 
 Real estate  investments may be subject to a higher degree of market risk because of concentration in a specific industry, sector or geographical sector. Real estate investments may be subject to risks including, but not limited to, declines in the value of real estate, risks related to general and economic conditions, changes in the value of the underlying property owned by the trust and defaults by borrower. 
 Relative Value Strategies  maintain positions in which the investment thesis is predicated on realization of a valuation discrepancy in the relationship between multiple securities.  
 Small-capitalization  investing typically carries more risk than investing in well-established ""blue-chip"" companies since smaller companies generally have a higher risk of failure. Historically, smaller companies' stock has experienced a greater degree of market volatility than the average stock.

 The latest FX forecasts 
 •  USD: Near-term forecasts are still leaning bearish USD . RoW LEIs are still turning up, while data momentum has overtaken the US. DM Earnings Revisions Indices have all recently turned positive, typically a bullish equity signal. This blunts the safe haven appeal of the USD. Relative rate momentum, looking at 5y nominal US-G9 rates vs 100dMA, still favours RoW. Excess savings in the UK, EA and Japan are higher than in the US as a % of GDP. 
 • Big picture, Citi analysts still like USD lower. The convergence trade and subsequent asset reallocation away from the US still makes sense and are already evident in Citi data momentum spreads and equity fund flow data. 
 •  EUR: China risks are concerning but European recovery has other supports . The 2022 terms of trade shock continues to unwind with European gas prices reaching new cyclical lows. Real wages in Europe continue to trend up while excess savings remain at the highs. This also suggests the European recovery can be endogenously consumption lead, rather than reliant on Chinese growth. EUR arguably looks like a next best alternative to USD for reserve managers, where USD allocations have been on downwards trends for the majority of the last decade. 
 •  JPY: Citi analysts see risk that USDJPY goes sideways for the next quarter , as global recession pricing looks vulnerable which can lead yields higher, pressuring JPY. Longer term, Citi analysts expect a US recession in Q4 and risk of a BoJ policy shift around the same time. The combination of a material US duration rally, and potentially higher Japanese yields, would dramatically narrow the USD-JPY rate differential. Given uncertainty around the depth of the US recession and signs that the US labour market may be stronger for longer, the 6-12m forecast was upgraded to 125 from 120. 
 •  AUD: Weaker China, lower commodity prices and doubtful RBA hawkishness to weigh on AUD . Domestically, employment data showed labour markets slowing faster than the RBA forecasts. This adds reasons for RBA to hold and see this summer. Citi analysts now moved their final hike to August. Citi analysts watch closely for any meaningful support from Chinese authorities or credit easing announcement, as a sentiment shift would be hawkish AUD and commodity-linked FX. 
 •  GBP:  UK data improving, BoE want to pivot but data isn’t weak enough yet.  The UK has experienced a very positive terms of trade shock, and excess savings in the UK are larger than in US or EA. This could mean that macro divergences between UK and DM peers take longer to set in. Relative data surprise and nominal rate differentials have been a good signpost for these trends. Both have supported the recent GBP rally on the crosses, amid fairly bearish sentiment across the board on the UK. In the longer term, Citi anlaysts still think that domestic fragilities in the UK remain in the forecast horizon, which brings on balance larger risk of growth and monetary policy divergences in favour of Europe.

 • We believe that there may be at least one more rate hike in June to 3.5%. The ECB may continue to follow the data dependency approach. 
 • Ultimately, the medium term story for EUR vs USD remains solidly positive on numerous fronts – (1) euro area’s relative growth resilience versus the US with the OCIS team expecting euro zone to avoid a recession altogether whereas the US is expected to face one later this year ; and (2) a likely pronounced and long-lasting divergence in the ECB’s monetary policy path with the Fed as OIS rates price a much more rapid Fed easing cycle than the ECB.

 • Citi analysts expect the RBNZ to hike rate by a further 25bp at the May 24 policy meeting, taking the peak rate to 5.50%. 
 • The medium-term outlook may see NZD finding support vs USD from a combination of a strengthening Chinese economy and rising prospect for Fed rate cuts later this year that could lift the pair to 0.66 –0.67 level during H2. 
 • But NZD’s recent outperformance on non-USD crosses looks unsustainable as NZ financial conditions at their most restrictive within the G10 sharply raise the odds of an extended hard landing.

 Important Disclosure on High Yield Bonds  
 Unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities typically offer a higher yield than investment grade Debt Securities, but also present greater risks with respect to liquidity, volatility, and non-payment of principal and interest. As a result of being classified as non investment grade Debt Securities, these Debt Securities present a greater degree of credit risk relative to many other fixed income Debt Securities. Higher Credit Risk – Unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities generally have predominantly speculative characteristics with respect to the issuer’s capacity to pay interest and repay principal. There is greater risk of non-payment of interest and loss of principal. Many issuers of these Debt Securities have experienced substantial difficulties in servicing their debt obligations, which has led to default and restructurings. The issuers of these Debt Securities generally have to pay a higher rate of interest than investment grade Debt Securities. Higher Liquidity and Secondary Market Risk – The markets in which unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities are traded are generally more limited than those in which investment grade Debt Securities are traded. This lack of liquidity may make it more difficult to resell these Debt Securities and obtain market quotations. Downgrade Risk – Downgrades in the credit rating of unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities by rating agencies are generally accompanied by declines in the market value of these Debt Securities. In some circumstances, investors in the unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities market may anticipate such downgrades as a result of these credits being placed on “credit watch” by rating agencies, causing volatility and speculation of further credit deterioration. Higher Vulnerability to economic cycles - During economic downturns, unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities are typically more susceptible to price volatility and fall more in value than investment grade Debt Securities as i) investors may reevaluate holdings in lower-quality bonds in favor of investment-grade corporate Debt Securities; ii) investors become more risk averse; and iii) default risk rises.  This is often referred to a “flight to quality”. Event Risk – This includes any of a variety of events that can adversely affect the issuer of unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities, and therefore the issuer’s ability to meet debt service obligations to repay principal and interest to Debt Securities holders. Event risk may pertain to the issuer specifically, the industry or business sector of the issuer, or generally upon the overall economy. It could have a direct or indirect impact on the issuer and their outstanding debts. 
 Important Disclosure on RMB 
 Risk relating to RMB – If you choose RMB as the base currency or the alternate currency, you should also note the following: RMB is currently not freely convertible through banks in Hong Kong. Due to exchange controls and/or restrictions imposed on the convertibility, utilization or transferability of RMB (if any) which in turn is affected by, amongst other things, the PRC government's control, there is no guarantee that disruption in the transferability, convertibility or liquidity of RMB will not occur. There is thus a likelihood that you may not be able to convert RMB received into other freely convertible currencies. CNH exchange rates and CNY exchange rates are currently quoted in different markets with different exchange rates, whereby their exchange rate movements may not be in the same direction or magnitude. Therefore, the CNH exchange rate may be different from the CNY exchange rate.

as a result of these credits being placed on credit watch by rating agencies, causing volatility and speculation of further credit deterioration.', 'Higher Vulnerability to economic cycles - During economic downturns, unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities are typically more susceptible to price volatility and fall more in value than investment grade Debt Securities as i) investors may reevaluate holdings in lower-quality bonds in favor of investment-grade corporate Debt Securities; ii) investors become more risk averse; and iii) default risk rises.', 'This is often referred to a flight to quality.', 'Event Risk This includes any of a variety of events that can adversely affect the issuer of unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities, and therefore the issuers ability to meet debt service obligations to repay principal and interest to Debt Securities holders.', 'Event risk may pertain to the issuer specifically, the industry or business sector of the issuer, or generally upon the overall economy.', 'It could have a direct or indirect impact on the issuer and their outstanding debts.', 'Important Disclosure on RMB Risk relating to RMB If you choose RMB as the base currency or the alternate currency, you should also note the following: RMB is currently not freely convertible through banks in Hong Kong.', ""Due to exchange controls and/or restrictions imposed on the convertibility, utilization or transferability of RMB (if any) which in turn is affected by, amongst other things, the PRC government's control, there is no guarantee that disruption in the transferability, convertibility or liquidity of RMB will not occur."", 'There is thus a likelihood that you may not be able to convert RMB received into other freely convertible currencies.', 'CNH exchange rates and CNY exchange rates are currently quoted in different markets with different exchange rates, whereby their exchange rate movements may not be in the same direction or magnitude.', 'Therefore, the CNH exchange rate may be different from the CNY exchange rate.']"

 WWW.KKR.COM 3 INSIGHTS: OUTLOOK FOR 2023: KEEP IT SIMPLE 
 Despite all the uncertainty across today’s global capital markets, we are poised to enter 2023 with a more constructive tilt, especially on many parts of Credit.  Our basic premise is that it will be easier to navigate inflation’s negative impact on corporate earnings and consumer balance sheets in 2023 than it was to invest with inflation continually surprising central banks and investors in 2022. However, what we are proposing will require both patience and courage – and a game plan that leverages the type of long-term frameworks we employ at KKR across asset classes and regions. At its core, our message is to ‘Keep it Simple’ in 2023. The massive increase we have seen in short-term interest in many instances has created attractive total return opportunities across several parts of the global capital markets without having to stretch on leverage, volatility, and/or risk. Implicit in our outlook is our strong view that now is a good time to be a lender. As such, we continue to lean towards collateral-based cash flows such as Infrastructure, Private Credit, Real Estate Credit and many parts of Asset-Based Finance. We also like some of the convexity that liquid Credit provides after the recent sell-off. Within Equities, our advice is to shift away from larger- capitalization Technology stocks in favor of smaller capitalization names with better valuation profiles. History suggests that 2023 will be a good vintage year for Private Equity. We also see the U.S. dollar’s strength reversing, which means that many international assets need to be re- considered. Finally, while we see the positive relationship between stocks and bonds easing in 2023, our longer-term view remains that we have entered a regime change that requires a different approach to overall global macro and asset allocation. 
 Truth is ever to be found in the simplicity, and not in the multiplicity and confusion of things.

 With a higher resting heart rate for inflation amidst record stimu- lus, we have been cautioning for some time that we see a ’dif- ferent kind of recovery‘, and that investors should ‘walk, not run’ when it comes to deployment, especially as the correlation be- tween stocks and bonds turned positive. No doubt, we still think the macro environment remains challenging, but we now feel more emboldened as we think about deployment entering 2023.  
 Key to our thinking are the following considerations   1 
 Global central banks are much further along in their tightening campaign , As Chairman Powell said recently, rates are ‘getting close’ to sufficiently restrictive levels. Our work shows that the share of the top 25 central banks boosting rates will fall to 12% in 2023, compared to fully 84% in 2022. This decline is an important one to consider, we believe. We also think the chance of the U.S. dollar bull market continuing well into 2023 is now much more limited. This macro consideration is a big deal, in our view 
 2 
 United States inflation has peaked , though it remains quite high. In fact, with this publication, we just tweaked our inflation forecast lower for the first time in almost two years. See below for more detail, but a ‘tug of war’ between falling housing prices and rising labor costs now better reflects the Fed’s intentions to cool the economy. 
 3 
 Capital markets new supply (i.e., new issuance), which we track closely as a proxy for calling bottoms, has dwindled essentially to nothing . In the United States, for example, we measure that it is now approaching the lows we saw in 2009, especially when one adjusts for the growth in GDP since then  (Exhibit 1) . 
 4 
 A more visible hand: We think government spending will quietly surprise on the upside in 2023 . Our travels to major political hubs such as Washington DC, Paris, and Tokyo of late lead us to believe that key initiatives like the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA, which we think could be closer to $700 billion versus the ‘headline’ of $370 billion) and EU Recovery Budget (€1.8 trillion over 2020-2026) will result in more spending than many folks think. Meanwhile, spending on military budgets is increasing around the world, as geopolitics is no longer a discretionary line item in most government budgets these days. Finally, in China, for example, our local research leads us to believe that further stimulus is gaining momentum to offset the headwinds created by recent property developer defaults.  
 5 
 The technical picture is actually quite compelling . Many allocators have de-risked their portfolios, especially allocators who likely over-emphasized the stability provided by bonds as we transitioned from QE to QT. We also take comfort that the S&P 500 has already corrected 25%, an important ‘lean in’ signal based on history, as well as that most High Yield bonds now trade at 85 cents on the dollar, another signal that one should add back some risks to a diversified portfolio. Importantly, our view is that the massive adjustment in the risk-free rate, not necessarily a record widening of credit spreads, will be what is remembered about the opportunity set created during this tightening cycle.

 So, after what we believe will be a dismal earnings season in January,  we think investors should accelerate to at least a jog from a walk in terms of deployment budgeting for 2023 as well as lean more aggressively into the periodic bouts of dislocation we continue to forecast during the next 12-18 months . Simply stated, the recession fears we face in 2023 are likely less ominous and more in the price than the inflation fears that surprised markets in 2022.  
 To be clear, though, we are not advocating a  full  ‘risk-on’ approach like we did after COVID roiled the markets. So, our call to arms is not to ‘buy the market’ with abandon. Rather, it is to be selective within and across asset classes. Key to our thinking is that: 
 1.  Earnings estimates are still too high , and falling unit volume in recent months will become more apparent as inflation cools. European earnings, in particular, look to be at risk in the first half of 2023. 
 2.  Some parts of the market still need to correct . Large cap ‘old economy’ Technology stocks, for example, are still over-owned by both institutions and individuals. This reality is also occurring at a time of increased competition and regulatory oversight. Looking ahead, we see Technology being less than 20% of the S&P 500 weighting within the next few years, compared to what we think was a peak of 29.1% in 4Q21. See below for details on our analysis.  
 3.  There are still some spicy capital structures, debt in particular, in challenged sectors  of the economy that will be tested in the slower growth and higher rate environment we envision. Negative operating leverage, ‘layering’ of old debt with new debt (a product of weak documentation during the go-go years), and refinancing risks will all be important issues to sidestep in 2023, we believe.  
 4.  We still don’t fully understand QT . The European and the U.S. central banks both want to shrink the size of their massive balance sheets, which now total 65% and 33%, respectively, of their GDPs. Translating this reduction into rate hike equivalents feels much more like art than science,  
 and as such, our expectation is that this process takes longer and acts as more of an overhang on liquidity and financial conditions than in prior cycles. We also forecast that short rates do not come down as fast as the consen- sus expects, given that we see inflation being above the Fed’s target for at least five years in a row (2021-2025e).  
 5.  We expect to see some unexpected provisioning around Office Real Estate and non-secured consumer lending in 2023,  which could surprise some banks and investors in the coming quarters. 
 So, against this backdrop, our most important message is to keep it simple and buy simplicity . Indeed, as Isaac Newton once said, “Truth is ever to be found in the simplicity, and not in the multiplicity and confusion of things.” We think it is also the time to diversify across multiple asset classes � not concentrate one’s portfolio the same way one would have during the 2010-2020 period. 
 If we are right, then Credit makes more sense to own than Equities right now across most asset classes. Indeed, given that many traditional banks are reining in their lending, now is a good time in many instances to be a provider of capital, especially to businesses that align with our key themes. Just consider that our S&P 500 target is up only marginally versus current levels, while senior Direct Lending offers returns well north of 10%. Within Credit, keep it simple. Specifically, we favor shorter duration, bigger companies, and attractive call protection features. Further, we also still favor collateral linked to higher nominal GDP growth.

 Rate of Change Matters . While we still see a higher resting heart rate for inflation this cycle, we think that headline inflation peaked in the latter half of 2022. We expect a peak tightening of financial conditions to occur in 2023.  
 We recently lowered our 2023 U.S. inflation forecast for the first time in almost two years to 3.9% from 4.8%. As part of this transition, we expect nominal GDP growth to slow by fully 50% to about four percent in 2023 from 10% in 2022. As such, we expect the dollar to be less of a headwind to financial conditions in 2023. We also expect less duration risk for bonds, a notable change in our thinking about asset allocation. 
 Earnings.  We have higher conviction in our long-held view that earnings will decline in 2023, and we see a lower than normal rebound in EPS in 2024. This backdrop means creaky capital structures will be under pressure, especially those with challenged margin expectations  
 It is too early to just buy all risk assets across the board. Rather, an allocator should focus on long-term attractive valuations in key areas such as Small-Cap Equities, unlevered Private Credit, Real Estate Debt, and select parts of High Yield and Investment Grade Debt. Defendable margins will be key across all asset classes. 
 Labor.  We are growing more convinced that the worker shortage in the United States is structural in nature, given the intersection of demographic trends and pandemic- related behavioral changes. All told, in the U.S., for example, we think the labor force is missing about four million workers, with only about half likely to return at some point. So, we concur with Chairman Powell’s view that the labor market is “out of balance.” 
 This realization is part of our thesis that structurally higher inflation is the new normal and will be ‘stickier’ for longer. We favor automation, digitalization, and family care services, all of which help to address the current labor shortage. We also think it is more important than ever for management teams to be aligned with their workforces. 
 House Prices Under Pressure.  Housing is one of the most direct ways that central banks have been able to slow growth. In the U.S., for example, we now forecast home price depreciation of minus five percent in both 2023 and 2024, respectively. Previously, we had assumed modest home price appreciation in our annual forecasts. 
 Household net worth is falling faster this cycle than any other cycle on record ( Exhibit 27 ). As such, being right that unemployment does not spike is a key underpinning to our overall macro thesis. Remember we have unemployment in the U.S. increasing trough to peak by 1.4%, compared to an average of 3.7% during recessions. 
 Goods Deflation, Services Inflation.  We have higher conviction in our goods deflation thesis; at the same time, we believe that inflation has shifted to the services arena and will stay higher for longer.  
 Our long exposures remain much more tilted towards Services than Goods. We continue to forecast a recession in the Goods sector in 2023, partially offset by an increase in global Services spending. 
 Asynchronous Recovery.  It is too simplistic in our view to simply talk about one synchronized global economy. Asia’s inflation and monetary policy profiles are now wildly different than the West’s. Meanwhile, the U.S. is food and energy independent at a time when Europe and Emerging Markets are experiencing an unprecedented ‘war shock.’ 
 Despite our view that the U.S. dollar is peaking, our models still do  not  show Emerging Markets as a high conviction ‘Buy’. As such, we continue to favor selectivity across regions. For example, we like corporate carve-outs in Korea and Japan, and we favor higher growth markets such as India and Vietnam. 
 Real Rates.  Despite near record tightening, we see real rates staying below three percent this cycle. By comparison, the Fed brought real rates above three percent at least one time each decade from the 1960s through the early 2000s. 
 Our base case has fed funds reaching 5.125% in mid-2023 be- fore settling in at 4.875% by year end. The market is much more bullish on the Fed accelerating rate cuts in late 2023/2024. Meanwhile, in Europe, we forecast the ECB to boost short rates to 3.5% in 2023 through the end of 2024. We expect a longer- term neutral rate closer to 2.25% in Europe.

 We also want to mention that 2023 will feel a lot different than 2022. We note the following:  1 
 The pace of central bank tightening is likely peaking.  The percentage of the top 25 global central banks that will be tightening by the end of 2023 will likely be closer to 12%, compared to around 84% in the fourth quarter of 2022.  2 
 After surging to double-digit levels post pandemic, we see nominal GDP growth cooling in 2023 . We expect U.S. nominal GDP to fall to 4.2% in 2023 from 9.9% in 2022. This is a big drop and likely means that duration becomes less of a cycle risk over the next 12 months.  3 
 We forecast that U.S. real wage growth will likely turn positive in 2023.  If we are right  and  unemployment lags versus other cycles, we do States.  not envision a 2008-type downturn in the United  4 
 We no longer see the USD as a safe haven.  We expect the recent dollar downtrend to continue in 2023, and as such, we are looking for hedges that will perform if the U.S. dollar actually weakens further than expected.  5 
 The negative impact of inflation will shift from resetting upward the risk-free rate in 2022 to putting pressure on corporate profits and consumer balance sheets in 2023.  If we are right, then longer-term rates may peak temporarily as earnings disappoint.  6 
 China’s re-opening in 2023 helps Asia get out of its growth funk.  We have growth above consensus in both 2023 and 2024. We think China’s shift in its zero COVID-policy leads to a run of better growth in Asia by the middle of next year. 
 Our bottom line:   As we enter 2023, it is important to note that we still live in a world where both investors and corporations are struggling to accurately price the cost of capital across different parts of the economy as well as different parts of the capital structure. Therein lies the opportunity, we believe . 
 In terms of key signals we are watching to pick up the pace of deployment, the following three data points are top of mind. See below and SECTION III for full details, but we think that all of these may happen sometime in mid-2023: 
 1.  The Fed stops tightening as inflation comes under control, and in doing so, it further cools the U.S. dollar  (Exhibit 2).  
 2.  Earnings estimates trough (remember though that overall earnings tend to bottom six to nine months after markets do.) 
 3.  We enter a technical recession in the United States during 2023 (markets tend to bottom about half way through a recession,  see  Exhibit 90) .

 In terms of key themes, we note the following:  
 Buy Simplicity Not Complexity at this Point in the Cycle.  When markets get expensive, we have often favored complexity over simplicity to avoid overpaying (see  Play Your Game: Outlook for 2020 ). This current period, however, is not one of those times. When it comes to Credit, investors should buy high quality credits and mortgages where the company or collateral is cash flowing. For cross-over funds, we particularly like preferred or convertible security offerings that plug a financing hole, especially where there is an incentive to get called away within a few years and/or pay down the debt. Within Equities, small cap stocks are cheap by almost all metrics, and on a currency adjusted basis Real Estate in the UK and many sectors in Japan (banks and certain multinationals in particular) are cheap, we believe. By comparison, now is not the time to try to call the bottom on unprofitable Tech or lend to a zombie company to capture an additional 100-200 basis points of yield.

 Real Assets: We Still Favor Collateral-Based Cash Flows and Continue to Pound the Table on this Theme.  Our proprietary survey work suggests that because too many investors are still underweight Real Assets in their portfolios, there remains a high degree of latent demand for this asset class across insurance companies, family offices, and endowments and foundations. Moreover, the fundamentals are compelling, especially on the Energy, Asset-Based Finance, Real Estate Credit, and Infrastructure sides of the business. Also, as we detail below, we think that Real Assets, and Energy in particular, could be a really important hedge if the dollar is not as strong in 2023. 
 Ongoing Labor Shortages Will Only Accelerate the Trend Towards Automation/Digitalization.  With labor costs soaring amidst sluggish demographics, a dearth of trained workers for key sectors, a lower participation rate and less immigration, we think that corporations will focus increasingly on technology-driven productivity gains. To this end, we recently saw robots ‘working’ in both Heathrow Airport and a restaurant in Tokyo. Without question, we are still in an era of innovation, and think that the pace of disruption will only accelerate, particularly as it relates to technological change across multiple industries faced with increasing labor costs. So, if history is any guide, worker scarcity will inspire another era of automation discoveries including a greater focus on worker re-training ( Exhibit 6 ).

 Resiliency: The Security of Everything.  Recent travels across Asia, Europe, and the U.S. confirm that, as my colleague Vance Serchuk often reminds me, we have shifted from a period of benign globalization to one of great power competition. This shift is a big deal, and it means that countries, corporations, and even individuals will need to build out more redundancy across not only energy but also data, food, pharma, technology, water, and transportation. These sectors and their supply chains will be subject to greater geopolitical oversight, in terms of both industrial policy intended to build national providers of these services and also scrutiny of foreign investment and resiliency of supply chains. Also, almost all aspects of defense spending are poised to surge, we believe. All told, our ‘security of everything’ concept represents hundreds of billions of dollars in opex and capex that may help to cushion the blow of the global economic slowdown we are experiencing.

 The Energy Transition Remains a Mega-Theme.  This theme is probably as massive as the Internet opportunity was around the turn of the century. It will likely lead to the same variety of outcomes and bifurcation in results � think Pets. com’s bankruptcy versus Amazon’s success. Said differently, there will be both winners and losers as this mega-theme unfolds, though the generosity of the recent Inflation Reduction Act should lead to more winners than losers in the United States, we believe. Interestingly, though,  while the Internet was a deflationary global force, the energy transition is an inflationary one .

 Normalization:   Revenge of Services.  For the better part of two years now we have been suggesting that U.S. consump- tion would eventually normalize, with Services gaining wallet share at the expense of Goods. That call has largely been the right one over the last year, and we think it will continue to play out in 2023. Given that U.S. Goods buying is still run- ning seven percent  above  trend (down from a peak of 17% in 2021) and Services is running one percent  below  trend (up from six percent below in 2021), we continue to support flip- ping exposures towards Services, which we now think could run ahead of trend for several more years. However, this is not just a U.S. call. In Asia, for example, the economy is now just opening up, and as a result, Services activity is still well below pre-COVID levels. As such, if the U.S. is a precursor to what other economies will experience, sectors such as tour- ism, health and beauty services, and entertainment still have a long way to go internationally, we believe.

 In terms of Picks and Pans, we note the following: 
  PICK (SAME)  Simple Credit looks attractive to us.  True, spreads have not blown out like in 2008, but the risk-free rate now embeds a lot of bad news, and absolute yields look extremely attractive in a world that we think argues for lower overall returns for most portfolios during the next 5-10 years. At the moment we like high quality municipal bonds, mortgages, CLO IG /A-AAA liabilities, senior direct lending, etc. See our relative value discussion in SECTION III –  Question #1  for full details, but we want to be a liquidity provider when others can’t.  
  PICK (NEW)  Distinct   sector   selectivity within public markets . From a public market sector perspective, we favor Energy, Industrials (including Defense names), and Big Pharma at the expense of Large Cap Technology and any unsecured lending across Financials and/or Consumer sectors.  
  PICK (NEW)  The Russell 2000 is at an attractive entry point for long-term investors, in our view.  All told, the Russell 2000’s next 12 months P/E ratio has fallen to 10.8x, its lowest level since 1990 and 30% below its long-term average. On a relative basis, the Russell 2000’s next 12 months P/E is trading at the lowest level versus large-cap stocks since the Tech Bubble. 
  PICK (NEW)  International hard assets.  Many global currencies are still on sale, and as such, we think that strategic buyers are going to start shopping overseas for hard assets, especially in the Real Estate and Infrastructure sectors. Therefore, we believe allocators will need to move quickly to acquire quality Real Estate assets in key metro markets such as London, Paris, and Tokyo. We also like fiber and data plays across most parts of the world, a theme we have been aggressively playing through our Infrastructure allocations at KKR. See below for details and  Exhibit 2  above, but we view the current period as a unique opportunity where, on a dollar adjusted basis, hard assets in many parts of both Europe and Asia still look quite attractive.

 WWW.KKR.COM 13 INSIGHTS: OUTLOOK FOR 2023: KEEP IT SIMPLE 
  PICK (NEW)  ‘Cyclical’ hedges that might work as the dollar weakens, including select EM and Commodities, such as Oil and Copper.  Our travels and conversations with CIOs lead us to believe that most investors, regardless of region, are overweight dollar-based assets. This decision has been the right one in recent years, but the technical picture makes us want to add some ‘spice’ in the form of out of the money copper and/or oil calls, or some beaten down EM where we like the long-term fundamentals (e.g., Vietnam). 
  PICK (NEW)  Dividend yielding and growing Equities.  As those who have followed our work know, we have been advocating owning rising earnings and rising dividend stories over different periods over the last twenty years. Now is one of those periods, we believe. To be clear, we don’t favor just high dividend yields. Rather, we favor companies with rising free cash flow that allows them to consistently increase their dividends and earnings per share. See our note  The Uncomfortable Truth  for further details, but one could also just buy the Dividend Aristocracy basket and call it a day. 
  PICK (NEW)  Non-correlated assets should be added at the expense of traditional long/short hedge funds,  we believe. Too many allocators are still overweight long/short equity funds in their hedge fund portfolios. Our base view is that more CIOs should be concentrating their book in hedge fund managers that can provide non-correlated returns to equity markets. We also think that allocators should align with managers that ‘stay in their lanes’ in terms of liquidity. Indeed, as we learned in our recent endowment and foundation survey (see  The Times they Are a-Changin’ ), many CIOs now own illiquid hedge fund portfolios in their liquid books.  
  PICK (NEW)  Private Vintages.  As we show in  Exhibit 18 , the value of the illiquidity premium tends to increase in bumpy markets. Linear deployment is essential to portfolio construction in the private markets, and one of our key messages for 2023 is to lean into both Private Equity and Private Credit right now. 
  PAN (NEW)  Begin to sell USD.  Despite the USD coming back towards earth in recent weeks, we still think the dollar is overbought and over-owned. It clearly has been the right call to own dollar assets for several years ( Exhibits 2, 99,  and  100 ). However, we feel that this trade has begun to turn. We like JPY as a long against the dollar as well as some higher yielding, higher quality EM currencies. Tactically, we also think the EUR may have bottomed.  
  PAN (SAME)  Similar to last year, we are still cautious on large cap Technology . This sector is valuation challenged at a time when fundamentals, especially around online advertising and social media, are still deteriorating and competition is increasing. At the same time, we continue to think that globally, greater government regulation of Tech is increasingly on the table at a time when global geopolitical competition is heating up.

 as we suggested in our midyear outlook, we still see private label taking aggressive market share from branded products. 
  PAN (NEW)  Segments of Commercial Real Estate may face incremental headwinds in 2023.  In our view, certain parts of the traditional  Office  sector could face challenges in 2023, especially older properties that 1) do not have environmentally friendly footprints; 2) will need to roll their debt at higher rates; and 3) are exposed to sectors that face significant headcount reductions or work from home headwinds (e.g., large parts of the Technology sector). There is also growing concern that some banks may foreclose on office buildings at reduced prices, which could reset the entire market for commodity office buildings. Don’t get us wrong, though, there are significant opportunities in Office Real Estate and we are actually believers in back to work, but one needs to be eyes wide open that using the ’old‘ playbook will not yield the same results as in the past. To this end, we think a significant opportunity exists in buying high quality new assets at discounts to replacement costs in high growth markets, especially as market participants may sell assets to deleverage other parts of their portfolios. 
  PAN (NEW)  Interest rate volatility is now overstated and should be sold, particularly at the front end of the curve.  Key to our thinking: the fed funds futures market won’t experience a 400 basis point surprise in 2023 the way it did in 2022, and bond yields and term premia are now much closer to our targets. Against this backdrop, hedging against higher interest rates entails a more nuanced tradeoff, in our opinion, while securities with built-in call risk such as MBS should become more appealing. 
 In terms of risks to our overall outlook, there are four major risks where we are focused:  
 Risk #1: Growth Slows Sharply Towards More of a 2008- Type Downturn.  Our forecasts are predicated on growth slowing but not collapsing in a 2008-like fashion. One can see this in  Exhibits 22  and  23 , respectively. There are three things to consider, we believe. First, we forecast unemployment increasing by 1.4% point trough to peak  
 today, more akin to the 1.9% increase in 2001 compared to 2008 when unemployment surged 5.1%. Second, we also don’t see the banks needing to de-leverage as much as they did during the GFC. Most leverage levels are at 10-12x, not 20-30x. Finally, we do not think that underlying equity in mortgages gets impaired, given better underwriting, tighter supply, and more equity in each deal. To be sure, we have house prices falling five percent in 2023 ( Exhibit 113) , down from 14% appreciation in 2022, but we do not forecast a major collapse in major economies such as the U.S, France and Germany ( Exhibit 14) . So, if the environment becomes much worse than we anticipate and we experience 2008-like stresses to the system, then our decision to steadily add risk during 2023 could be the wrong one.

 Risk #2: We Go Back to Secular Disinflation (i.e., 2010- 2020).  Our macro calls as well as our asset allocation positioning could be out of whack if inflation crashes towards pre-pandemic levels (i.e., we go back to the lower left quadrant in  Exhibit 16 ). If this happens, then the ‘right’ playbook is to go back to what worked in 2010-2016 (average inflation during this period was just 1.6%). Said differently, if there is not a higher resting heart rate for inflation this cycle, then investors should lean into high growth, low cash flowing equities with big total addressable markets (TAMs), and/or own super long duration fixed income. However, given that we see wages being stickier this cycle amidst strong demand for 25-54 year old workers ( Exhibit 13 ), we ascribe less than a one in five chance to this outcome.

 Risk #3: The Fed Needs to Do Substantially More to Control Inflation.  Our current base case expects the ‘real’ fed funds rate (i.e., fed funds – Y/y CPI) to rise to just above two percent in 2024 ( Exhibit 17 ). That forecast is materially higher than the peak of about 80 basis points on a quarterly basis during the last Fed hiking cycle, but lower than the median peak over the last sixty years (which is actually around three percent or more). Indeed, history would suggest that the Fed may end up delivering more tightening than we currently expect in order to control inflation in 2023, particularly given the fact that wage growth remains high and consumer inflation expectations remain elevated. If we are wrong about how high rates need to go this cycle to quell strong wage growth (i.e., if real rates need to rise above two percent), it could materially dent the outlook for all risk assets. However, we see the chance of this occurring at less than one in four; moreover, there are several ways to hedge these considerations in a cost-efficient manner, including through fed funds futures.  
 Moreover, as we look at the bigger picture, our base view is that macro fat tails are narrowing, not widening, as we enter 2023. As such, we think the possibility of very low inflation, really high inflation, or a 2008-type event is fading, not increasing. So against this backdrop, our message is to thoughtfully lean into risk using a disciplined deployment schedule, sound portfolio construction, and ample diversification across asset classes and regions in 2023.

 Risk #4: Heightened Geopolitical/Political Risks  Harking back to Adam Smith’s famous work, it feels to us that we have entered an era where the visible hand of politics and geopolitics appears to be quickly overpowering the invisible hand that defined increased economic globalization/harmony during the past few decades. Indeed, throughout the world (U.S., Europe, China), nations that have for a generation maintained legitimacy and support by delivering strong economic growth in part via cheap money, energy, and labor are now entering eras where all of these inputs are more expensive – at a time when institutional legitimacy is at an all-time low and populism is high. Moreover, this backdrop is occurring at a moment of heightened geopolitical tensions. This combination will likely mean more unexpected political outcomes such as government shutdowns as well as more changes in approaches to government (e.g., Brexit); it also means much more FDI scrutiny and possible restrictions. On the one hand, there are real opportunities to invest as nations build domestic energy, semiconductor, and other supply chains. To this end, we remain quite bullish on our Resiliency/Security of Everything thesis, including the benefits of reshoring. On the other hand, investors will need a sharper domestic political and geopolitical lens for all investments in this new era of great power competition.  
 Section I: Global / Regional Economic Forecasts 
 Global 
 Our message on growth and inflation for much of the developed world remains largely the same as in prior years. Specifically, we continue to expect slowing growth and higher inflation than many developed economies experienced during the post-GFC era. What has changed is that consensus has now chopped a lot of wood in ‘catching down’ to this new reality. As a result, we enter 2023 with greater optimism that our conservative bent towards a de- rating of growth expectations is now more likely in the price. Meanwhile, in China we now look for better growth in both 2023 and 2024, which puts our forecasts above consensus, as consumption improves. We do see near-term risks to our China outlook as infections rise during the next several months, which will likely weigh on mobility and spending. On the other hand, increased immunity could provide a tailwind for growth in the second half of 2023 and into 2024.  
 In terms of important develop- ments we are watching for, they differ by region. In Asia, we ex- pect continued normalization in consumer activity, which should help year-over-year comparisons, especially in the Services sec- tor. In Europe, we expect a war- induced recession, though fuel subsidies and a mild winter should help. Finally, in the United States we look for a 2001-type reces- sion, driven by weakness in hous- ing and inventory destocking.

 U.S. GDP Outlook  As we show in  Exhibit 24 , we retain a conservative outlook for U.S. GDP. Home prices have declined faster than expected this year, which leads us to take down our 2023 U.S. Real GDP growth estimate modestly from +0.5% to +0.3%. From a bigger picture perspective, we note that full-year GDP growth at that level is more consistent with a 2001-style recession than a 2008-style growth implosion. For example, we forecast monthly unemployment to increase 1.4% from a trough of 3.5% to a peak of 4.9% this cycle. That would be in line with 2001’s 1.9% increase, and well below the GFC’s 5.1% increase.

 As our quantitative model  (Exhibit 24)  shows, consumer excess savings have been helping to sustain growth better than what one might think. On the other hand, both high energy prices as well as falling housing activity are acting as major drags. Unfortunately, given some of our recent survey work around mortgages  (Exhibit 25) , interest rates are now at such a level that buyers will likely re-trench for some time, we believe.

 In terms of specific components to GDP, my colleague Dave McNellis forecasts consumer PCE growth falls to almost zero in 2023, down materially from +2.7% in 2022. He does see some improvement thereafter, as the benefit of positive real wage growth eventually flows through the system. At the same time, however, Dave has a stronger forecast for capital expenditures, which one can see in  Exhibit 28 . The Inflation Reduction Act could surprise on the high side in terms of spending, we think, while our conversations with CEOs lead us to believe that capex and opex will not fall off as much as during prior downturns. This tailwind should help to offset weaker consumer spending as well as ongoing inventory de- stocking ( Exhibit 26 ).  
 Looking out to 2024, our expectation is that GDP growth re-accelerates only modestly to 1.5% from 0.3% in 2023. Importantly, we see the hangover of a soft U.S. housing market continuing into 2024, given that we expect Fed policy will remain tight and mortgage rates elevated. We also think that goods-related consumption spending will be slow to recover following what was a surge of pandemic-era buying in 2020-21. These headwinds offset other positives that we see potentially emerging as we look out into 2024, including resilient commercial capex spending and improvements in net exports as Europe and Asia start to emerge from economic soft patches.

 U.S. Inflation Outlook  We are revising down our 2023 full-year U.S. CPI forecast to 3.9% from 4.8% previously. Notably, this is the first time we have taken down an inflation forecast since 2021. We think the back-to-back downside surprises in October and November U.S. CPI were indeed significant, as the details showed a convincing pattern of peaking shelter inflation, cooling medical inflation, and falling goods prices, consistent with our longstanding thesis on deflationary goods and inflationary services. While these developments do not make us want to lower our outlook for fed funds (in fact, we are raising our December 2023 forecast +25 basis points to 4.875%), they do cause us to assign less weight to our high case Fed scenarios (See U.S. Rates section, below, for more details).  
 Without question, the road ahead will still be bumpy, with durable goods potentially cooling in a nonlinear manner and government data catching up to the rent growth that is already incorporated into our proprietary leading indicators. Moreover, we continue to expect CPI to settle at a higher resting rate this cycle, most notably because labor costs and consumer expectations remain inflationary. However, the good news is that the direction of travel has definitely improved, which gives us more confidence that the U.S. will avoid our worst-case scenarios for inflation and Fed tightening this cycle. 
 Key U.S. Inflation Takeaways   1 
 We have higher conviction that goods inflation will be negative on a year-over-year basis in 2023. That being said, we do not expect goods prices to cool in a linear fashion as some companies have pushed through price increases even as real consumer demand has stagnated. 
 2 
 Services inflation appears to be stabilizing, albeit at levels that remain much too high. Importantly, within Services, shelter inflation is in the process of peaking, we believe.  
 3 
 Labor costs are the single most inflationary input into our KKR Core CPI indicator. While we think that overall inflation has likely peaked, the combination of higher incomes and a higher tolerance for inflation raises the risk of periodic re-accelerations in CPI over the course of this cycle. 
 4 
 Corporate margins will remain under pressure in 2023. The reality of higher labor costs amidst slowing nominal GDP will create a backdrop that further dents margins for businesses. 
 Bottom line:  We now have greater conviction that core inflation has peaked, which diminishes the odds of a worst-case scenario when it comes to peak fed funds. At the same time, we continue to be guards-up about earnings as wage growth rises above CPI inflation and goods prices turn negative year-over-year. Said differently, the focus is shifting from ‘how high inflation goes in 2022’ to ‘how high inflation stays in 2023 and beyond’, meaning that defendable margins are becoming more important as price growth cools heading into next year.

 Europe 
 Euro Area GDP Outlook  We revise up our estimates for growth in 2023 from -0.5% to -0.2%, primarily reflecting a less severe energy shortage due to the unseasonably mild start to the winter in 2022-2023, and introduce a forecast for 1.6% growth in 2024. We also note that despite a roughly 25% fall in gas consumption across the economy, industrial production has thus far held up well compared to pre-war norms. Finally, the level of fiscal support offered by governments has surprised to the upside, most notably in Germany, where the economic ‘defense shield’ alone makes €200 billion available to offset the impact of the current energy shock. Despite these positives, we still expect the Euro Area economy to contract due to tighter financial conditions caused by restrictive monetary policy (not just reflecting higher rates, but also quantitative tightening),  
 alongside higher inflation depressing household spending power and impacting corporate earnings.

 Fiscal Response to Energy Crisis: Allocation to Shield Households and Firms From Rising Energy Costs, % of GDP 
 Data as at November 29, 2022.Source: Bruegel. 
 Key Euro Area GDP Takeaways   1 
 We expect high energy costs to curtail household purchasing power as well as force some manufacturers to curb production. However, fiscal support should provide some cushion. 
 2 
 Tighter financial conditions will likely be a drag on business investment. Weaker global demand could hurt export growth for Europe in 2023 despite a weak euro. 
 3 
 Uncertainty around gas supply is the key downside risk to GDP. Further disruption to gas markets (e.g., adverse weather conditions or a complete halting of Russian gas flows) puts GDP and our mild manageable recession forecast at risk. In this scenario, we model a more severe recession lasting into 1Q24, with a peak to trough fall in GDP of 2.5%.  
 4 
 Our bull case is based on the assumption of a gradual relaxation of tension in global energy markets and easing inflation concerns, leading to Eurozone GDP growth in 2023 of 1.5%. 
 5 
 We expect labor markets to remain more resilient than in previous crises due to structural tightness in labor supply and consequent reluctance of employers to cut workers. 
 Bottom line:  We believe investors should plan for the Eurozone economy to contract by 0.2% over the next twelve months before entering a period of moderate recovery, with growth of 1.6% in 2024.

 Euro Area Inflation Outlook  We revise up our inflation forecast for 2023 to 6.3% from 5.5% compared to a consensus of 5.9%. For 2024, we expect inflation to cool to 2.6% versus a consensus estimate of 2.5%. The impetus for our revision remains higher energy and food prices, both largely compliments of the ongoing war in Ukraine. However, we also see underlying core inflation proving stickier than anticipated, as firms continue to pass on higher production costs to consumers. What are the upside risks to our forecasts? While not our base case given supplies have largely been filled for this winter, further disruption to gas supplies would likely increase inflationary pressures in the Euro Area, as would adverse weather considerations, and tighter gas markets, particularly if/when Chinese LNG demand returns towards normal.  
 The other key area of focus for investors is wage growth. So far, households have been taking meaningful real wage cuts, amidst surging inflation. However, if employers are forced to step up their compensation, there is the additional risk of a wage-inflation spiral, further embedding inflationary pressure.

 China  
 China GDP Outlook  We forecast that China GDP growth will improve to 5.2% in 2023 and 5.4% in 2024, up from 2.5% in 2022. These estimates are higher than the consensus forecast of 4.8% for 2023 and 4.8% for 2024, respectively. Key to our thinking is that China’s exit from zero-COVID and reopening will help bring consumption back to trend in 2023- 24, while looser fiscal policy and infrastructure investment will help support broader activity. At the same time, we see signs that the property sector is bottoming, helped by government policy aimed at disarming liquidity and default risks, with housing sales likely stabilizing at a low level following a dismal 2022. 
 In the near term, how China navigates the COVID reopening process remains a key area of focus for us. Three years into the pandemic, China is finally abandoning its rigid COVID controls and aligning its approach to the virus with the rest of the world. But with only a 40% booster rate for the 80+ year-old population, and limited immunity from previous infections, we continue to think that China is likely to experience a medical resource shortage in the coming months. Said differently, even though restrictions intended to combat the virus have been lifted, the virus itself may impact both domestic activity and global supply chains in the near term. 
 The good news, however, is that we expect these dislocations to be short-lived, with a clearer recovery starting in 2Q23 once the current surge in infections fades and immunity improves. In particular, we think that China’s consumer economy is primed for a strong recovery, especially in categories like travel. To this end, we note that total retail sales in China are still running about 12% below the pre-pandemic trend, while excess cash deposits now total RMB22 trillion, which equates to fully 51% of 2021 retail sales. Importantly, the experience of other regional economies suggests that consumer spending can recover quite robustly after reopening – for instance, Korea and Japan’s easing of COVID restrictions in 2021 has led to consumption at or above pre-pandemic trends in 2022.

 Maybe more importantly, China’s share of global exports has in- creased to 15.0% today from 12.9% in May 2018. In other words, decoupling from China is proving more challenging than the rhetoric, and implementation of more regional supply chains will take time. According to the U.S.- China Business Council’s 2022 survey, China remains a priority for doing business for 97% of re- spondents, and a top five priority for 77% of respondents.

 We also wanted to flag that, despite all of the rhetoric around U.S.-China tensions and decoupling between East and West of late, China has actually become more integrated into the global economy in many instances. Indeed, when former President Trump imposed tariffs of 15% to 25% on China’s exports to the U.S., trailing 12 months U.S. imports from China amounted to $526 billion. As of 3Q22, that amount stands at $568 billion, an increase of eight percent.  Maybe more importantly, China’s share of global exports has increased to 15.0% today from 12.9% in May 2018 . In other words, decoupling from China is proving more challenging than the rhetoric, and implementation of more regional supply chains will take time.

 Key Big Picture China and Asia Takeaways   1 
 Many factors weighing on China have reached peak pain and should begin to improve from here, including an exit path from zero-COVID and less of a drag from the property market (-0.5 ppt in 2023 vs. -2.9 ppt in 2022) now that the Authorities have stepped in.  
 2 
 Consumption should also begin to improve from near record low levels, as mobility increases (retail sales are currently 12% below trend).  
 3 
 In Japan, valuations are attractive (30% of companies trading below book value) on a long-term structural basis and the economy is about half way through the growth slowdown. The weak yen has improved competitiveness for Japanese products and services. Despite the recent strengthening, the yen is still extremely cheap at 40% below its average real effective exchange rate.  
 4 
 From a valuation perspective, Asia looks attractive as P/E is down approximately 60% vs. ‘just’ 40% in the U.S. Overall earnings are flat in Asia, but China credit growth has turned positive, which likely means the rest of Asia will soon follow. Revisions too are now turning positive. 
 5 
 However, geopolitical risks remain an overhang across the region and as such necessitate an added risk premium when thinking about returns. Aligning with long-term government objectives, particularly in China, remains important. 
 Section II: Key Macro Inputs 
 U.S.   Rates 
 In our view, Fed policy in 2023 will be defined by how the FOMC balances two competing imperatives: 1) cooling what remains an overheated labor market, versus 2) managing the potential adverse impacts of further tightening on the housing market, which is already showing overt signs of weakness. On the one hand, the U.S. worker shortage is getting worse on a secular basis, in our view, which means that the Fed will likely need to deliver more tightening over the course of this cycle than markets currently expect. On the other hand, we do not think the housing market can tolerate short-term rates holding above five percent on a sustained basis.  
 Our base case envisions the Fed ‘threading the needle’ between these two constraints, with rates rising modestly  
 in the near term, but then staying higher for longer as policymakers seek to contain inflationary impulses in the labor market. We think this approach would be consistent with Chairman Powell’s recent comment that policymakers are focused on effecting ‘persistent moves’, rather than ‘short-term moves’, in financial conditions. 
 Specifically, we see the Fed hiking rates to the low five per- cent range next year before cutting slightly as inflation and GDP slow heading into year-end. More precisely, we forecast short rates peaking out at 5.125% in 2Q23 and ending 4Q23 at 4.875%. Thereafter, our base case envisions the Fed’s policy rate drifting toward a higher resting ‘neutral’ level, hit- ting 4.125% at year-end 2024 and 3.375% at year-end 2025 before settling around 3.125% in 2026 and beyond. 
 How do we arrive at these forecasts? Our models suggest that fed funds holding above the low five percent range on a

 sustained basis would push mortgage rates into the mid- seven percent range – which is above the seven percent threshold that our proprietary KKR 2022 Homebuyer Survey indicated would lead most active homebuyers to abandon their searches. Mortgage rates at that level would also put more pressure on housing affordability, which is already at a 40-year low  (Exhibit 44) . In that scenario, we think that homebuyers stepping back from the market would flow through into materially lower home prices and weaker consumer balance sheets, increasing the risk of a more jarring U.S. economic downturn. As such, housing market dynamics imply a 5.125% ‘speed limit’ for fed funds this cycle, we believe. 
 On the other hand, we think that the Fed is increasingly concerned about what Chairman Powell called a ‘structural labor shortage’ putting sustained downward pressure on U.S. unemployment, as a demographics-driven slowdown limits the number of young people joining the labor force, while the effects of early retirements during COVID continue to impact the availability of older workers. Said differently, it seems likely that U.S. wage growth has experienced a level-shift higher during the pandemic, which means that the Fed will need to hold rates higher for longer to meet its dual mandate of low unemployment and low inflation, in our view. That aligns with our analysis in  Exhibit 46 , which suggests that the Fed will need to hold rates near five percent through late 2023 in order to bring inflation closer to its two percent target. 
 If we are right, then the good news is that the ‘fat tails’ of much higher or much lower rates are narrowing. However, there are still serious upside risks to consider, particularly for the next 12-18 months. To capture these risks, we have built a detailed scenario analysis for our deal teams. One can see this in  Exhibit 43 , which shows that we still see a cumulative 35% chance that the Fed raises rates to the high- five percent range next year (i.e., higher than our base case of 5.125%, which we assign 55% weighting). We believe a more aggressive Fed tightening cycle could occur either:  
 1. Because the relationship between housing markets and interest rates is weaker than we expect and higher rates are required to cool inflation (our ‘High’ case); or  
 2. Because the Fed overtightens in the near-term and is then forced to cut as the housing market deteriorates (our ‘Overshoot’ case).  
 Both of these risks demand serious consideration, which is why we encourage investors to hedge exposure to higher rates in the near term if possible. Importantly, though, our framework suggests that upside risks to our base case should diminish over time, particularly as the lagged effects of bal- ance sheet policy begin to play out in the real economy. As a result, the term premium on U.S. bonds, which compensates investors for longer-term uncertainty, should diminish, too.

 Fed Funds Scenarios, % 
 Scenario Year-End 2023 FF Year-End 2024 FF Year-End 2025 FF Longer-Run Comments 
 Base Case (55% chance) 
 4.88% 4.125% 3.38% 3.13% • In our base case, the Fed continues to hike rates through mid-year 2023, peaking just above five percent and ending the year slightly lower in the high four percent range. 
 • In 2024 and 2025, the Fed has room to cut rates modestly in response to falling inflation and motivation to do so from a housing-market slowdown, but policymakers still ride the brake with a higher ‘neutral’ rate for fed funds at 3.125% in 2026 and beyond. 
 Overshoot Case (15% chance) 
 5.63% 3.88% 3.13% 3.13% • A re-acceleration in inflation and consumer inflation expectations lead the Fed to continue hiking aggressively in 2023 even as the U.S. economic backdrop softens.  
 • Ultimately, the Fed hikes too far in a slowing GDP environment and is forced to cut aggressively in 2024 as financial/ economic conditions worsen and home prices turn over. 
 Low Case (10% chance) 
 2.88% 2.13% 1.88% 1.13% • We assume a worsening recession that cools inflation significantly by the end of 2023, with services activity falling along with goods. 
 • In this case, we are wrong about a ‘different kind of cycle’ and return to an environment of secular stagnation, with the Fed chasing nominal GDP growth lower. 
 High Case (20% chance) 
 5.63% 5.63% 5.13% 4.88% • Similar to the overshoot case, inflation/ employment pick back up next year, and the Fed continues to hike aggressively in 2023 to prevent a wage-price spiral.

 Accordingly, at the long end of the curve, my colleagues Dave McNellis and Ezra Max think 10-year treasury yields will end 2023 at 3.75%, versus 4.25% in our previous forecast. Thereafter, we have 10-year yields drifting towards 3.25% over the longer-term. One can see our forecasted progression for long-term rates in  Exhibit 50 . The key input here is our expectation for the term premium to rise toward 50 basis points in the near term to reflect heightened uncertainty around the path of fed funds, before gradually drifting toward 20 basis points through 2025 (which is still well above the 2010-2020 average of just 1.5 basis points, as shown in  Exhibit 49 ). Their call for a higher average term premium this cycle reflects several factors, including 1) the fact that inflation remains elevated and volatile, 2) the larger outstanding stock of U.S. debt, particularly in light of Fed QT, and 3) structurally lower investor appetite for duration as a ‘shock absorber’ following what has been the worst 60/40 portfolio performance in roughly 100 years. 
 So, what’s our bottom line? The good news is that we think central banks are getting closer to the ultimate peak level of

 interest rates this cycle, led by the Fed ( Exhibit 47) , which helps take some of the worst-case scenarios for equity multiples off the table. On the other hand, both short rates and bond yields will likely remain higher on the other side of this hiking cycle than most market participants are used to. Said differently, our summary expectation is that the U.S. rates outlook will stop being a headwind for markets over the next 6-12 months, though we do not envision Fed policy becoming a tailwind the way it has in recent cycles.  
 European Rates 
 We see the ECB deposit rate topping out at 3.5% in 2023, and then we have it remaining there through the end of 2024. By contrast, market pricing currently implies a depo rate peak at around 3.25% in 2Q23, with the first rate cuts in 2Q24. We also believe the 10-year bund yield will rise to three percent in 2023 and stay there through 2024. This view continues to be an important area of differentiation for us, as the consensus for the 10-year bund is for two percent at end-2023 and end-2024. 
 It’s important to note that our forecasts imply 50 basis points of yield curve inversion from the depo rate to the German 10-year. This forecast reflects our assumption that the long- term neutral rate for the depo rate is 2.25%, and that the ECB will be forced to cut rates to that level starting in 2025. Given this, the 10-year rate is likely to stay below the depo rate, but we believe only about 50 basis points below, as quantitative tightening will keep upward pressure on rates at the long end of the curve. 
 Importantly, the ECB is also about to begin quantitative tightening, or QT, as early as March, as President Lagarde guided in the December meeting. QT is particularly challenging in Europe, we believe, because there are 19 bond markets for the central bank to consider. Some peripheral markets, notably Italy, have inherent weaknesses that may drive rates there above what the ECB desires for monetary policy reasons. Policymakers do have a couple of levers under the QT umbrella and will likely not apply QT to the  
 ECB’s entire bond portfolio at once (likely stopping the reinvestment of maturing securities in the Asset Purchase Program – representing 60% of the total volume of bonds it holds – but continuing to reinvest under the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Program – which holds 40% of QE bonds).

 Bigger picture, regarding ECB policies, there are two opposing forces at play: 1) the risk of a de-anchoring of inflation expectations (i.e., a cycle in which higher consumer expectations become self-fulfilling) and 2) flagging economic activity. Importantly, industrial output has held up better than feared this year despite higher energy costs, while governments have unrolled large, un-targeted fiscal stimulus to help protect households. We believe these developments will give the hawks the upper hand to enforce a focus on #1, and to try to control inflationary concerns by erring on the side of more restrictive policy. 
 In thinking through the upside risks to rates, the key area of focus for investors is wage growth. So far, households have been taking meaningful real wage cuts amidst surging inflation. However, if employees begin to demand wage growth well in excess of inflation in 2023, then we would expect a strong hawkish reaction from the ECB. On the other hand, our dovish scenario rests on a deeper-than-expected recession increasing slack in the economy and opening up the possibility of medium-term weakness in inflation. 
 S&P 500 
 How are we looking at the path forward for the S&P 500?  We expect a bumpy ride towards our year-end 2023 S&P 500 price target of 4,150. Our frameworks still point to an earnings recession next year, as the full impact from the Fed tightening cycle this year is still working its way through the economy. Even so, we recommend buying into market dislocations that arise in coming months, as risk assets will likely start discounting a recovery in 2024 by the second half of 2023, in our view. While U.S. large-cap equity valuations are not unambiguously cheap, their long-term expected returns have already improved significantly since the start of the year (to six to seven percent per annum from one to two percent in December 2021). In addition, our analysis of significant market breaks since 1940 suggests that investors with patient capital are generally rewarded over the next three to five years for leaning into dislocations of the magnitude we have seen this year ( Exhibits 3  and  91 ).

 Our Base Case (50% probability):  We assume a central bank-induced U.S. recession – albeit a modest one – leads to a 10% earnings decline in 2023 (with EPS falling to $200 per share), which we think is an outcome that the market has not yet fully digested, particularly given that the bottom-up consensus still expects plus four percent growth. Key to our thinking is the following: 
 1. Increasing conviction that the ISM manufacturing index will fall further into contraction territory next year ( Exhibit 58 ).  
 2. The typical post-war earnings decline during mild U.S. GDP recessions has been around 10% on average ( Exhibit 59 ). 
 3. With 30 year fixed mortgage rates having risen above six percent from a low of around three percent in late 2021, home purchase affordability has deteriorated at a record rate. As such, we expect housing-related economic activity—which accounts for roughly 20% of U.S. GDP— to slow significantly next year.

 From a fundamental perspective, we expect margins to come under pressure as a sharp slowdown in nominal GDP growth is likely to coincide with sticky wage inflation and weaker labor productivity ( Exhibit 60 ). This backdrop, we believe, will limit how much companies can continually raise prices to offset elevated input cost pressures. Moreover, as we have been highlighting for some time, our Earnings Growth Lead Indicator (EGLI) suggests that earnings will be challenged in 2023. In fact, as  Exhibit 62  shows, our forecast for -10% earnings growth in 2023 is actually less aggressive than the model, given our view that the energy input might be overstated. 
 Against this backdrop, we are publishing our ‘official’ price target for the S&P 500 of 4,150 for 2023 and 4,390 for 2024.  Included in these forecasts are target multiples of 17.7x for 2023 and 17.3x for 2024, respectively . To be sure, these targets represent only moderate upside from current trading levels. However, we do not think investors should expect a raging equity bull market under almost any scenario in the current macro regime, which now reflects a combination of higher real interest rates, more competitive yields on Credit and Real Assets, and a Federal Reserve that remains comfortable with tighter financial conditions, given stickier and more volatile inflation. All these factors will continue to keep a lid on valuation multiples, in our view.

 We also augment our base case with probabilistic bear and bull cases  ( see  Exhibit 55)  to account for the more volatile macro environment: 
 Our Bear Case (35% probability)  assumes that an aggressive hiking cycle drives the U.S. economy and the housing market into a more severe economic recession. The Fed is unable to pivot and keeps the terminal rate higher for longer owing to un-anchored inflation expectations and persistent realized inflation. Corporate margins collapse to 10-year lows, driving an 18% earnings decline in 2023. In the face an elevated risk premium and a higher discount rate, the S&P 500 fair value would be closer to 3,050-3,100 in 2023 and 2024, which is in-line with prior bear market troughs of 14-15x NTM P/E – Exhibit 61 . 
 Our Bull Case (15% probability)  assumes that inflation eases faster than expected, allowing the Fed to engineer a soft landing for the U.S. economy. Robust household balance sheets prop up consumer spending, while an acceleration in re-shoring activity boosts investment and productivity. Corporate margins stay near highs, with earnings growing approximately five percent in 2023, helping to drive a swift decline in the equity risk premium. Under this scenario, the S&P 500 could rally back towards 4,730 by end-2023 and new highs of 5,060 by end-2024 (consistent with 18-19x NTM P/E). 
 So, our bottom line is that Equities, as measured by the S&P 500, represents modest value in today’s market. By comparison, small cap stocks and Credit appear much more attractive.

 As we look towards 2023, our expectation is that more volatility lies ahead, as we transition from the adverse impact of inflation on multiples towards its negative impact on earnings growth, margins in particular. Interestingly, as we looked to forecast earnings for 2023, our fundamental, historical and quantitative approaches all suggested around a 10% decline in earnings. The good news, however, is that, with the market having sold off meaningfully in 2022, we think the current environment actually provides an attractive entry point for long-term investors. Moreover, there is also a relative game to play too. Specifically, we see a significant opportunity for allocators to invest behind companies with defendable margins and/or sectors like Big Pharma, Energy, and Industrials that are not over-owned by institutional and individual investors at a time when multiples look more reasonable than earnings forecasts.

 Oil 
 Even amidst fundamental headwinds related to slowing economic growth, a strong dollar, and shifting consumer behavior in response to high prices (e.g., U.S. gasoline demand has dipped down to levels last seen in the immediate aftermath of pandemic lockdowns in 2H20), we remain constructive on the outlook for energy and energy-related investments in 2023 and longer term. As shown in  Exhibit 65 , we look for an average WTI crude price of $82.50 in 2023 and $80 over the longer term in 2024-26. These estimates are well above futures strip pricing, which embeds $72 on average in 2023 and around $65 over the longer term. 
 Looking at the details, global crude inventories remain notably lean ( Exhibit 66 ), which leaves the market without a good buffer against a number of upside risks for oil in 2023. These upside risks include 1) potential shortfalls of Russian supply related to EU embargoes; and 2) potential outruns of oil demand if global jet fuel consumption (which remains around two million barrels per day below 2019 levels) and/ or Chinese demand (which is still about one million barrels per day below peak levels) come back more quickly than expected. These risks loom at a time when little swing supply is available, given that OPEC is already producing near peak capacity, and the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve has fallen to the lowest levels in 40 years on a demand-adjusted basis.

 Latest forecasts as of December 8, 2022. Prior as of November 1, 2022. Forecasts represent full-year average price expectations. 
 Our bottom line for 2023 is that we think WTI crude continues in a wide and volatile trading range, but one that skews higher than the $72 average currently embedded in market pricing. Overall, we expect pricing to oscillate between $70-110, averaging around $82.50. We view $70 as  
 a near-term support level, as OPEC seems inclined to defend this price, and because the Biden administration has also committed to prop up global demand by refilling the SPR at around this level. These factors create important support at a level we might otherwise think the market could breach,

 given what remains a fundamentally weak backdrop for demand  (Exhibit 67) . Meanwhile, we use $110 as the high end of our range, because that is a typical level for oil at times of lean inventories and geopolitical-related risks such as those discussed earlier. $110+ is also an approximate level where we see more pronounced demand destruction risks.

 Looking beyond 2023, we think of $80 as being the ‘new’ mid-point of the long-term trading range for oil, up from the approximate $50-60 range that generally prevailed in the pre-pandemic era. What has changed, in our view, is that the marginal cost of U.S. shale production – which we think remains the key driver of incremental global supply – has shifted higher. We see several factors driving this structural shift, including: 1) a higher cost of capital, given uncertainty around how the energy transition will shape regulation and long-term demand, 2) a higher cost of drilling, given scarcities of equipment and labor, and 3) a higher premium placed by the market on firms that return capital versus reinvest it.

 Given these considerations, we now see U.S. oil production running well below what one would normally expect in the recent elevated environment for crude prices  (Exhibit 68 ). We see this as having constructive implications for energy and energy-related equities, which in many cases continue to price at double-digit free cash flow yields that look sustainable as long as oil can hold in the constructive range that we envision. 
 Looking beyond 2023, we think of $80 as being the ‘new’ mid-point of the long-term trading range for oil, up from the approximate $50- 60 range that generally prevailed in the pre-pandemic era. What has changed, in our view, is that the marginal cost of U.S. shale pro- duction has shifted higher.

 Section III: Our Most Asked Questions  
 Question #1: How are you thinking about relative value, including Credit versus Equities?  
 In recent months we have spent a lot of time as a team alongside our portfolio managers looking at relative value across both Equities and Credit. Overall, our models tell us that now is the time to begin to lean into risk assets. Indeed, as we show in  Exhibits 70  and  71 , a fair amount of bad news has been priced into markets unless one thinks a 2008-style banking collapse is imminent. We don’t see that type of de-leveraging, and as result, we are suggesting going from a ‘jog’ to even a ‘run’ in terms of deployment by the end of 2023.

 Credit again now more attractive 
 Data as at December 2, 2022, Source: Bloomberg. 
 Importantly, though, as we start picking up the pace towards increased deployment, we favor being a lender at first. Said differently, our models today suggest Credit is the better buy at current levels, especially if an allocator has the ability to build a broad-based portfolio across both private and public markets. 
 We see several factors at work. First, many large bank lenders are ‘hung’ with loans, which is preventing them from extending credit as much as in the past. Second, tighter capital standards by regulators and higher loan loss reserves are forcing financial institutions to hold more capital and issue fewer loans. Additionally, after the Fed and other central banks bought up a huge amount of government issuance as part of their pandemic-era QE programs, things are starting to move in reverse, with government securities displacing riskier debt on bank balance sheets. All of these factors have helped push credit yields to their highest levels relative to S&P earnings yields since COVID.

 Against this backdrop, it feels like a pretty good time to build positions across 1) Private Credit, as unlevered returns are now in the low double digits; 2) Liquid Credit, given the convexity the asset class offers at current levels. We have heard pushback that spreads need to widen a lot more to make the opportunity as attractive as it was in the past. We don’t necessarily agree, as the issue this time is inflation. As a result, the risk-free rate, which we view as the proper mechanism for capturing higher than expected inflation trends, has increased materially. For spreads to widen in an inflationary environment, we would generally need to see some deterioration in corporate margins (particularly when the term structure of corporate debt looks relatively benign). That would make it unlikely that we see spreads widening without nominal GDP slowing sharply and risk-free rates falling simultaneously. Said differently, we think that yields today are at quite attractive levels, which have historically made good entry points for longer-term investors.

 Importantly, within Credit, we are espousing our Keep It Simple thesis. Said differently, we prefer moving up in the capital structure, keeping duration in check, and not stretching on leverage. To this end, we favor the highest quality CLO AAA liabilities, senior Direct Lending, and some High Yield. One can see this in  Exhibit 76 . We also continue to like collateral linked to nominal GDP growth, including e.g. Real Estate Credit. Importantly, given the different convexities of the products (i.e., HY is trading at a material discount to par), we think that a multi-asset class Credit solution, including both private and liquid securities, could make a lot of sense in the macroeconomic environment we are envisioning.

 Meanwhile, we are seeing similar themes take place in Real Estate Credit. Ongoing volatility has caused a pullback in large sources of real estate debt financing, including banks and the CMBS market. Many debt funds and mortgage REITs are on the sidelines due to the inability to source cost efficient financing. This backdrop has created an opportunity for those with available capital to move up the capital structure and lend on high-quality assets owned by top institutional sponsors and located in growth markets at attractive all-in yields, lower leverage levels, and with more protective covenants.  
 To be sure, even though overall Credit as an asset class looks more attractive in relative terms, we also see emerging value in Equities. We are particularly cognizant of the fact that the Russell 2000, which is where many large-cap buyout firms play, looks attractively priced relative to large-cap U.S. equities. In fact, we believe that small caps will finally begin to outperform the S&P 500.

 Highly concentrated sectors underperform the market by  ��������������������������  the 3y following peak concentration 
 Peaks in market concentration include Energy 8/1980; Tech 09/2000; Financials 3/2007. Data as at October 31, 2022. Source: Factset, Bloomberg.  
 In terms of sector preferences across Equity indexes, we like Energy as a structural long against Technology, as the index weightings rebalance over the next few years. Our work shows that when sectors become larger than 20% of the S&P 500, they tend to lag. One can see this in  Exhibit 80,  which shows the collective underperformance that began for Energy in the early 1980s, Technology in 2000, and Financials starting in 2007. Beyond Energy, we also believe that Industrials and large cap Pharmaceuticals will perform well on both an absolute and relative basis  (Exhibit 79) . 
 Looking at the bigger picture, we think that now is the time to diversify more across asset classes. Central to our thinking is that we are leaving a period of low growth and low inflation in favor of lower real GDP and higher nominal GDP, albeit with more volatility. If we are right, then  Exhibit 81  represents an excellent way of discerning pockets of value. In our view, we think asset allocators should be overweight Small Cap Equities, Mortgages, High Yield, high quality CLO liabilities, and opportunistic Private Capital.

 Question #2: Do you think we are still in a regime change, given the recent improvement in U.S. inflation?  
 Since the onset of COVID, we have been talking about a different kind of recovery, or a different regime that would require a new approach to asset allocation. Key to our thinking has been that volatile inflation would impede central banks’ ability to step in and provide ample support during periods of dislocation. Importantly, in this current cycle, demand-side inflation, which many investors are used to seeing, would actually be super-ceded by supply-driven inflation. We note the following supply-side constraints:  
 1.  The energy transition is actually inflationary , as it requires many hard to find inputs in volatile parts of the world, while most of the processing of these commodities  
 occurs in China, which provides its own unique set of challenges. Cobalt, for example, is mined in scale in the Congo, while most of the Manganese in the world comes from South Africa. Moreover, fully 65% of the total global refining of such commodities, including lithium (72%), cobalt (71%), and manganese (99%) is now done in China. 
 2.  Geopolitics creates supply chain headwinds , requiring redundancies that are structurally more inflationary in nature, as the world becomes less globally integrated. In fact, since we last wrote about this topic in our midyear outlook, we have seen more examples of major companies building out duplicate supply chains with an eye toward geopolitical risks, rather than focusing solely on manufacturing costs. All told, in 2022 U.S. companies

 have revealed plans to reshore nearly 350,000 jobs, compared to 110,000 in 2019. 
 3.  Labor shortages, especially in the developed markets, fuel faster wage growth than in the past.  In the U.S., for example, our research suggests that the labor shortage will get worse – not better – in coming years, amidst a backdrop of lower participation for older workers and a demographic slowdown impacting the number of younger workers. The latest employment data confirm these trends, as the participation rate for 25-54 year olds is back near pre-pandemic levels, despite companies still having to pay out materially to retain workers.  
 4.  Lack of housing supply and rental properties in a period of accelerating household formation could lead to upward pressure on inflationary inputs . While home price appreciation has slowed of late, there is still a considerable mismatch between the supply of new homes and the number of new households that have been formed since the GFC. Somewhat perversely, higher rates hurt, rather than help, the housing supply issue that we have been identifying. As a result, we still see annual rental costs, which account for nearly one third of CPI, remaining stubbornly high well into 2023.

 Our bottom line: While we do think that cyclical inflation peaked in late 2022, we still believe that we will land at a higher resting heart rate for inflation this cycle. As such, the underlying structural inflationary dynamics created by the aforementioned four considerations will continue to constrain the ability of central banks to ease policy quickly. Consistent with this view, Chairman Powell in late December said that he does not see the Fed loosening policy until inflation is “definitely on track to again hit two percent.” Said differently, from a tactical investment perspective, we do expect the outperformance of Value stocks, collateral based cash flows (e.g., Infrastructure), and Commodities to continue in 2023, just not to the same degree. In fact, given how badly bonds performed over the past year, we are now less concerned about being long duration than we were in 2022.  
 However, beyond the tactical bounce that a slowdown in the pace of inflation could create, our longer-term outlook for the economy and markets reinforces our view that it is not business as usual. To this end, our conversations with CIOs suggest that investors will still need to add more Real Assets to their portfolios this cycle to protect against the regime change that we are forecasting. They may also need more floating rate debt in their portfolio, and they may want to  
 overweight more flexible capital that can lean into periodic dislocations. Maybe most importantly, we think that the recent positive correlation between stocks and bonds will continue, which likely means that Equities and Fixed Income will continue to sell off together in response to periodic bouts of inflation. In this environment, all else equal, 2023 is a time to keep it simple and own more assets that are positively linked to nominal GDP growth. See  Question #8  for more details on what this means for portfolio construction.

 Question #3: What indicators help us determine a bottom on overall risk positioning? 
 As we referenced earlier, we think that history suggests that both Equities – after falling 25% — and Credit — especially when it trades at 85 cents on the dollar or cheaper — appear attractive from a valuation perspective. One can see this in  Exhibits 3  and  4 , respectively. 
 However, we also understand that many investors want specific signposts for when to structurally lean in. To be sure, there is no absolute certainty around timing; each cycle is different based on monetary policy, growth dynamics, and inflationary trends. That said, there are some pretty standard indicators that my colleague Brian Leung and the team often watch. They are as follows: 
 Key Indicator #1: A Bottoming in the ISM  As we show in  Exhibit 87 , the year-over-year performance in the S&P 500 and the ISM manufacturing index are very tightly linked. To review, the ISM measures the change in production levels  
 across the U.S. economy from month to month, and it is released the first day of the month to indicate the level of demand for products by measuring the amount of ordering activity at the nation’s factories. According to Brian, our best estimate is that it will trough this cycle in the low 40s around mid-2023. One can see this in  Exhibit 87.

 Key Indicator #2: Markets Tend to Bottom in the Middle, Not the End, of Recessions  As we discussed in our economics section, we expect the economies of the developed world, the U.S. in particular, to be in a recession for much of 2023. However, we do see light at the end of the tunnel as we head into 2024. To this end, we roughly approximate that the ‘mid- dle’ of the recession we anticipate could be in the spring or summer of 2023. Importantly, given that equity markets and bond markets have sold off dramatically in advance of this potential event, we would rather be early than late on adding risk. This viewpoint is consistent with our thesis to not wait until the end of recessions to start to add back risks to one’s portfolio ( Exhibit 88 ). There are three factors that lead us to believe that 2023 will not be a prolonged, 2008-type down- turn. For starters, we do not think the banks need to de-lever

 the same way they did during the GFC. Second, while we think housing activity will slow, we are not forecasting any serious impairments to home equity. Finally, we think that unemployment will not surge the way it did during the Great Recession. In fact, labor is in short supply this cycle, which is one of the unique features of the downturn we expect.

 Key Indicator  #3:  The Fed Stops Tightening   There is the old adage ‘Don’t Fight the Fed.’ That viewpoint is particularly true, we believe, when the Fed is raising rates in 75 basis point increments. Hence, our decision to ‘walk, not run,’ in 2022 made sense. However, as one can see in  Exhibit 89 , market bottoms tend to occur when the Fed slows its hawkish campaigns. Though this cycle may be a little different, given the Federal Reserve’s sizeable balance sheet, we do not think it changes the message. As such, given that we have the Fed finishing its tightening campaign at 5.125% in 1H23, with cuts potentially starting by the end of the year, we think investors should be adding risk to their portfolios by mid-2023. 
 Key Indicator  #4:  Buy six to nine months ahead of a bottom in earnings estimates  Conventional wisdom is that markets bottom when the earnings slate is clean, and as one analyst put it to me, ‘forward earnings actually look achievable.’ Our work, however, shows that bear market lows usually occur 6-9 months  ahead  of earnings reaching their lowest point. One can see this in  Exhibit 90 . So, while we do think that earnings forecasts still look far too optimistic, if we are

 right that earnings will bottom by the end of 2023 before recovering in 2024, then the signal from EPS may actually be to ‘buy’ sometime in the middle of next year. 
 So, when we pull all our indicators together to assess this cycle, we feel that earnings and the behavior of the Federal Reserve are probably the signals to overweight. Key to our thinking is that we are transitioning from the markets re-pricing worse than expected inflation towards a period where inflation’s adverse effects dent corporate profits and consumer balance sheets. As such, we need to be right that 1) inflation is actually peaking and the Fed has some wiggle  
 room to slow its historic tightening campaign; and 2) this economic downturn is more akin to the shallow recession of 2001 than the harsh economic pullback of 2008. 
 Regardless of our short-term timing indicators, we also want to underscore that leaning in when markets have recently dropped 25% or more probably makes a lot of sense. One can see this in  Exhibit 91 , which looks back to other periods when the market sold off 25% or more dating back to 1940. To be sure, every cycle is different, but our bottom line is that long-term investors should lean into dislocations in the beginning of 2023.

 Question #4: Can you talk about the path of inflation and what it means? 
 As we have written about for quite some time, we view the current inflationary impulse as different because it is not just demand driven. Rather, we see structural supply driven headwinds, including the energy transition being inflationary, demographics driving tighter labor markets, and intensifying geopolitical dislocations causing unwelcome periodic price distortions.

 Importantly, the last time that we had a similar backdrop was the 1970s. To this end, we have spent a lot of time as a team trying to discern ‘lessons learned’ for investors from that era. From our vantage point, one of the most important conclusions is that, as we show in  Exhibit 94 , both the level and the rate of change in inflation matter. Specifically, after inflation reached surprisingly high levels in the early 1970s, markets rallied sharply as it came back down towards more manageable levels for a period of time.  
 This insight is important to us because, while we still do worry that inflation is at high levels, our team has increasing conviction that inflation has definitively peaked. Specifically, our forecasts show CPI cooling from 8.0% in 2022 to 3.9% in 2023. This viewpoint is also consistent with our proprietary core inflation indicator, which we show in  Exhibit 96 .

 What’s driving the decline in our model? The biggest single disinflationary impulse right now is coming from the goods sector, where input costs and supply chain pressures are easing against a backdrop of slowing consumer demand. At the same time, the lagged effects of monetary and fiscal tightening are beginning to show up in the real economy, with M2 money growth slowing precipitously, while medium- term consumer inflation expectations have started to cool at the margins. Finally, although rental inflation remains very high, our leading housing market data suggests that it has stopped accelerating. All of these data points indicate that inflation will continue to cool in coming months. In turn, we have higher conviction that the Fed will be able to step back from its tightening campaign by the middle of next year, which will bring more sustainable relief to equity multiples.

 That said, we still think that the high overall  level  of inflation will remain a concern over the course of this cycle, driven first and foremost by wages. Notably, our leading indicator for wages has not cooled off yet, and our forecasts show average hourly earnings at about 4.4% over the next three years, versus overall inflation of 3.0%. Maybe more importantly,  our long-term analysis suggests that the U.S. labor shortfall will only become more entrenched in the economy over the next decade, as we shift from a participation-related shortage of older workers during COVID to a demographics-related shortage of younger workers in coming years . This tension is a big deal, and it will put more pressure on margins, particularly in labor- sensitive sectors like Healthcare, Retail, and Leisure and Hospitality. 
 So, what’s our bottom line? We think that markets are transitioning from pricing in the impact of rising headline inflation on front-end rates and multiples, to pricing in the impact of high wage inflation on earnings. From a top-down view, that is a bullish signal, given that valuations tend to bottom out before earnings. However, it also means that we still think this cycle will punish business models that lack defendable margins and a clear ability to pass through higher input costs. It also leads us to continue to think that investors need more real assets and up-front/collateral-based cash flows in their portfolios.

 Question #5: How are you thinking about allocating the international markets? 
 For quite some time, allocating to non-U.S. markets within the liquid securities segment of most portfolios has been an inferior strategy from a performance perspective. In the last five years, for instance, the performance differential between the U.S. and other equity markets has been on the order of 900-1100 basis points, as one can see in  Exhibit 100 . Why have non-U.S. equity markets underperformed? On the one hand, a combination of sluggish earnings growth, valuation compression, and a rising U.S. dollar collectively has served as headwinds to international market returns. At the same time, the S&P 500 has enjoyed significant growth in Technology sector earnings, which has led to margin and multiple expansion for the entire index in recent years. All told, Technology hit 29% of the S&P 500 in 2021, compared to 21% at year-end 2016 and 19% at year-end 2011.

 As we look ahead, however, we think that the performance differential has become too extreme and is now likely to  
 narrow. As such, we are beginning to get more interested in non-U.S. listed Public Equities, including many parts of South East Asia. In particular, our proprietary KKR EM/DM model is suggesting that the difference between valuations in the emerging markets and the developed markets, the U.S. in particular, has gotten too wide. One can see this in  Exhibit 101.   
 To be sure, other important model inputs such as ROE, FX, and momentum continue to signal a more cautious stance. The good news is that if we are right about the U.S. dollar continuing to cool in 2023 and beyond, then FX should switch from a negative to a positive; when that happens, momentum could turn positive, too, which should create a constructive backdrop for rising ROE stories in our view. So, while we do not want to lead the leading indicator too much, we are certainly getting more intrigued by the set up for select parts of the public emerging markets arena.

 In Europe, we see a similar narrative. On an absolute basis, focusing on 12-month forward P/E, most European sectors appear quite attractive. Moreover, in relative terms, almost all of them are also trading on a lower multiple versus U.S peers, and when compared to the last ten years. One can see this in  Exhibit 103 . That’s the good news. The bad news, however, is that – as Aidan Corcoran has been highlighting – there is still likely to be heavy downward pressure on European earnings estimates in early 2023.

 So, what is our bottom line? Our call to arms for 2023 is that we see a tactical value trade to get long international Public Equities where we have confidence in the earnings backdrop, including both parts of Europe and select parts of the Emerging Markets. The dollar’s reversal will be crucial for our thesis to play out in 2023.  
 However, we do not want to confuse the tactical with the strategic. Without question, our long-term bias in overseas markets remains to compound capital via International Private Equity. Central to our thinking is that Private Equity portfolios are better equipped to gain exposure to compelling secular growth trends, many of which are still not always available in the public markets ( Exhibit 108 ). 
 In Asia, for example, we think that Private Equity is much better positioned than Public Equities to capture direct expo-

 sure to the rising middle class. Gaining access to this cohort is critical, we believe, as Asian consumers are entering the prime age to start families, buy homes, expand healthcare usage, and save more. Moreover, we are increasingly struck by how fast overall consumer behavior patterns are changing in the region as demographic shifts combine with new tech- nology (e.g., e-commerce) and urbanization trends  (Exhibit 105) . All told, we now forecast the Asian consumer market to surpass the U.S. during the next few years. One can see this in  Exhibit 104 . However, Consumer Discretionary accounts for just three percent of the CSI 300 Index in China, versus 10% of the S&P 500. 
 We also note that technology and innovation, two major areas of focus for KKR’s Private Equity deal teams, are massively underrepresented in many Asian countries’ public markets at the expense of state-owned Financials (see  Exhibit 107 , showing that Technology accounts for 0% of the MSCI Indonesia index).

 Europe is obviously a very different demographic opportunity, but in many instances, European Private Equity firms have been able to gain more targeted exposure to sectors like Technology, Media, and Communications. Indeed – despite all the geopolitical crosscurrents of late – our meetings on the ground in Paris, London and Madrid over the last twelve months has confirmed the robust opportunity for our local teams with thoughtful entrepreneurs and growing family businesses that see value in partnering with Private Equity. By contrast, Europe’s public markets offer far less exposure to growth sectors such as Software, Security, and Digitalization, which collectively comprise less than 10% of many high profile public equity indexes in the region. In fact, nearly 60% of the Eurostoxx index is concentrated in Financials, Industrials, and Real Estate at a time when rising energy input costs, central bank rate hikes, and a slowing global goods economy are putting more pressure on these sectors. That backdrop has allowed Private Equity to deliver superior absolute and relative performance, as one can see

 So, our bottom line is that weak currencies and attractive valuations make public international markets more interesting than in the past. Moreover, with positioning extremely light, we think that a growing handful of European and Asia  public  markets could surprise nicely to the upside in 2023. That is the tactical opportunity we see, especially if the U.S. dollar weakens a bit more than consensus expects.  
 Maybe more important, though, is the fact that key growth trends may not always be well represented in traditional public indexes in international markets. Therein lies the true strategic opportunity, we believe, for thoughtful CIOs to embrace investment vehicles such as Private Equity that actually gain sizeable, long-term exposure to these themes in order to drive returns well above the tactical opportunity we now see in the public international equity markets. 
 Question #6: What is your outlook for the U.S. consumer, wages, and housing? 
 In our midyear outlook, we described a bifurcation between U.S. consumers’ incomes and their balance sheets, with real wage growth turning negative for most households amid higher costs for essentials such as gasoline, and transportation. That call was, unfortunately, the right one. 
 Going forward, the good news is that – despite higher costs for food and shelter – consumers’ income statements may actually improve  in 2023, with real income growth flipping from negative to positive amidst cooling inflation and higher wages  ( Exhibits 109  and  110 ) .  Said differently, despite our call for a recession in the U.S. next year, we expect the labor market to hold up far better than in recent downturns  (Exhibit 23) . Key to our thinking is the unique combination of cyclical   and structural forces putting upward pressure on U.S. nominal wages this cycle, including a record number of job openings needing to be backfilled as a result of COVID-era retirements ( Exhibit 83 ) and a worsening shortage of younger workers in services professions as a result of slowing demographic growth. If we are right, then the surprise of 2023 might be that consumers actually have  
 more  real spending power than they did in 2022, particularly as households’ overall debt servicing costs remain quite low coming out of the pandemic .

 On the other hand, where we do see more signs of emerging risk is on the balance sheet side of the equation. Remember that the central bank-induced run-up in financial asset and real estate prices has served as major tailwind for higher- income consumer spending in recent years. Just consider that the average U.S. house appreciated $61,000 in 2021, nearly as much as the median household income of $71,000. Those dynamics are now starting to cool and in some cases reverse amidst a sharp correction in capital markets and an ongoing HPA slowdown, raising the possibility that fading wealth effects will offset improving real incomes and result in a downturn in U.S. consumer spending. That possibility is particularly concerning because balance sheets tend to mostly help high-end consumers, who account for the majority of U.S. consumer spending.

 So, amidst these cross currents, how do we see U.S. consumer spending playing out? On balance, we think that declining household net worth is likely to cause a 2001-2003 style ‘slowdown’ in consumer spending. However, we are not forecasting a GFC-style ‘collapse’, given resilient housing fundamentals, consumer cash balances and the ongoing normalization of services spending. 
 For starters, on housing, my colleagues Paula Campbell- Roberts and Patrycja Koszykowska recently reviewed their outlook for the U.S. housing market. Their key takeaway was that, even with higher mortgage rates, home prices continue to benefit from a  fundamentally constructive backdrop  related to demographic-driven demand amidst a chronic undersupply of housing  (Exhibits 114  and  115) . Specifically, Millennials – the largest generation of Americans – are entering first- time home-buying age at a time when the supply of existing single-family homes for sale remain near all-time lows. In  
 fact, the cumulative gap between new households formed compared to new housing starts since 2009 is on the order of 2.1 million, and the supply of existing homes is being constrained both by higher mortgage rates and by increased longevity of existing homeowners. As a result, while we do think that U.S. home prices will experience low single-digit year-over-year declines in coming years, housing wealth should still settle close to or above 2019 levels, providing a key support to consumer confidence and spending.

 Second, we would point out that  consumers are still holding a  lot  more cash than they were at the start of the pandemic.  The top four income quintiles – who collectively account for 91% of consumer spending in the U.S. – have seen their cash holdings balloon since 2019. In fact, the increase in checkable deposits is so extreme that the second,  
 third and fourth quintile each holds more cash today than the quintile above it did pre-pandemic  (Exhibit 116) . At an aggregate level, U.S. consumers now have nearly $5 trillion in their bank accounts, compared to approximately $1 trillion pre-pandemic, a 4.9x increase. To be sure, the savings rate as a percentage of disposable income has fallen to 3.1% from a peak of 33.8% during the pandemic, but our view is that there is still a lot of cash flowing around the system  (Exhibit 111) . In short, U.S. households are still sitting on plenty of ‘dry powder’ that will support spending, we believe. 
 Third, as we wrote earlier, we continue to think that consumption will increasingly shift from above-trend goods spending to below-trend services spending as the effects of stay-at-home COVID policies fade. This backdrop likely means that the consumer slowdown we’re anticipating will be largely concentrated in the Goods sector, rather than in Services. This viewpoint is important as services dwarf goods in the economy by 2:1. Moreover, within services, a lot of categories that were considered ‘discretionary’ in past recessions are increasingly becoming ‘new essentials’, with a stronger outlook for categories like omni-channel retail, personal care, ESG, home repair, and auto maintenance than one might see in a ‘typical’ recession.

 So, our bottom line is that amidst high inflation, higher interest rates and falling household net worth, the overall consumer picture in 2023 is definitely negative but not disastrous. However, within the consumer economy, we do expect a notable divergence. Specifically, while companies with defendable margins should hold up reasonably well this cycle, the corollary is that the ‘hit’ to consumer spending will disproportionately fall on durable goods companies and services companies with uncontrolled labor costs.  
 Question #7: What are your thoughts on expected returns this cycle? 
 We recently reviewed return assumptions across asset classes in both public and private markets. See  Exhibit 119  below for details, but our main takeaways were as follows: 
 1.  Fixed income returns should be higher than they were last cycle.  Higher projected Investment Grade and High Yield returns reflect, first and foremost, the  
 math of higher coupons in a world where we think bond yields settle in the 3-3.5% range. While corporate defaults are likely to rise from today’s ultra-low levels, the combination of higher nominal GDP growth and companies having termed out their debt during the pandemic should help keep credit losses relatively tame compared to past cycles. Meanwhile, while we think credit spreads may widen modestly, a sharp move would probably require a drastic slowdown in growth, which would in turn provoke a dovish pivot in Fed policy, too; said differently, we assign a small probability to an outcome in which  both  spreads widen  and  risk-free rates stay really high. 
 2.  Large-cap U.S. equity returns will likely be lower.  One consequence of our call for treasury yields to stay higher this cycle is that P/E ratios have only limited scope to re-rate from today’s levels. If we are right – and we think we are – then earnings growth, rather than multiple expansion, will drive the bulk of S&P 500 returns over the next five years. The good news is that even accounting for a near-term EPS downturn, strong overall nominal GDP growth should translate into mid-high single digit returns for large-cap U.S. equities. Though it is lower than what investors are used to from the last five years, that return profile aligns with the fundamental signal from our top-down five-year real returns model, which has a good track record of predicting real equity market returns from simple macro variables  (Exhibit 125).   Importantly, we are actually  more  constructive on both U.S. small-cap and certain non-U.S. stocks relative to the last cycle. Top of mind for us is that small-cap multiples have de-rated much more than large-cap multiples (Russell 2000 P/E is roughly two standard deviations below its long-run average, versus S&P 500 P/E near its long-run average), while a peak in Fed hawkishness should be a tailwind for foreign-currency assets. Outside of the U.S., we caution that investors need to pick the  right  market, particularly given idiosyncratic risks around de-globalization. Indeed, as mentioned earlier, public

 markets in countries like like Indonesia are actually overweight large financials, and at the same time, have very little exposure to rising GDP-per-capita stories in their public markets.  
 3.  Real Assets remain an asset class of choice.  No question, the cash flows from Real Assets become more appealing in an environment of higher nominal GDP growth. That thesis has been the backbone of our decision to overweight collateral-based cash flows in recent years. To be sure, we acknowledge that the performance of Real Estate and Infrastructure returns may slow relative to the last five years, which reflects first and foremost the fact that nominal GDP, while still quite elevated, is slowing. Nonetheless, we continue to think that Real Assets, especially Infrastructure, Energy, and Real Estate Credit, should be a larger part of investors’ portfolios in a world where real interest rates – even after a historic rate tightening campaign – remain relatively low. They are also an important ‘shock absorber’ if we are right that stocks and bonds will continue to sell off together (i.e., are now positively correlated) during bouts of rising inflation. 
 4.  The illiquidity premium will become more important amidst heightened volatility.  Even after inflation peaks, we think that the  threat  of higher inflation will present a new constraint on global monetary policy relative to the last twenty years. This new reality will limit central banks’ abilities to smooth fluctuations in markets, and increase volatility across rates, FX, and real GDP growth relative to past cycles. Against this backdrop, we think that there is more value in the illiquidity premium than there was during the post-GFC era  (Exhibit 18),  with alpha becoming a more important contribution relative to beta in private market returns.

 The bottom line for us is that investors will need a different playbook relative to what ‘worked’ during the last five years. Within public markets, leaning into large-cap U.S. Equities at the expense of everything else may not deliver the same results as it did in the past. In particular, we see better performance for Credit and for small-cap and non- U.S. equities. We also think that a larger illiquidity premium will emerge in private markets. We also see both the return profile of and the diversification provided by Real Assets remaining an important driver of portfolio performance in the coming years. Perhaps most importantly, we think that investors will need to take a more  holistic  approach to portfolio construction relative to past cycles, as many of the familiar relationships between asset-level returns have shifted in a world of high inflation and more restrictive interest rate policy.  Against this backdrop, we think that there is more value in the illiquidity premium than there was during the post-GFC era.

 Question #8. What is your latest view of the 60/40 portfolio? 
 For some years, we have argued that from an asset allocation and portfolio diversification perspective, quantitative easing likely overstated the importance of bonds as both income producers as well as ‘shock absorbers.’ In May 2022, Racim Allouani, who heads our Global Portfolio Construction Group at KKR, and Thibaud Monmirel, a colleague on Racim’s team, began to pound the table harder on this call as quantitative tightening accelerated, changing the underlying characteristics of existing portfolios. At that time, we published an  Insight s note  Regime Change: Enhancing the ‘Traditional’ Portfolio,  that made the case that the traditional 60/40 allocation wasn’t providing the same benefits to a balanced portfolio as in the past. As an alternative, we suggested considering an increase in allocations to more inflation resilient assets such as Private Credit, Infrastructure and Real Estate in a ‘40/30/30’ Equities/Bonds/Alternatives construct.  
 The bottom line for us is that investors will need a different playbook relative to what ‘worked’ during the last five years. Within public markets, leaning into large-cap U.S. Equities at the expense of everything else may not deliver the same results as it did in the past.

 Infrastructure and Real Estate assets often have inflation indexation increases embedded in their cash flows; the replacement value of their assets also increases in a rising nominal GDP environment. 
 30% Traditional Fixed Income plus 10% Private Credit 
 Shifting a portion of the portfolio to floating rate assets helps boost the income-generating component of the fixed income allocation. It also shortens the duration and provides some valuable diversification to the overall portfolio. Meanwhile, the remaining traditional bonds allocation still allows for some convexity if inflation does cool in 2023.

 Importantly, today we are not as adamant that the performance of the 60/40 is at risk, given that this benchmark portfolio has experienced its worst performance in 100+ years. One can see this in  Exhibit 121 . Said differently, a tactical rally may be in store, especially if we are right in our forecast that the U.S. 10-year yield peaked in 2022. However, our long-term viewpoint around portfolio construction is unchanged. Specifically, we continue to believe that, in the new macroeconomic regime we have entered, there are better ways to improve portfolio diversification and overall risk-adjusted returns beyond what the traditional 60/40 can provide, including our ‘40/30/30’ portfolio.

 60/40 Portfolio: Key Investing Conclusions   1 
 While the 60/40 portfolio could snap back in the short-term, our fundamental, long-term view that the correlation between Equities and Bonds has turned positive has not changed. As such, we think we are in a different regime for asset allocation.  
 2 
 We reiterate our view that a 40/30/30 Equities-Bonds-Alternatives allocation offers more robustness around diversification and inflation protection for the macroeconomic environment ahead. In the follow-up to our May 2022 portfolio construction paper, we examine our suggested 10% allocation to Private Credit.  
 3 
 We think that the case for Private Credit is actually more compelling today than when we wrote our original piece in May 2022. This asset class is benefitting from traditional lenders being sidelined, as capital charges mount amidst a large amount of ‘hung’ loans. We also see improved lending terms, higher absolute rates, and larger companies. 
 4 
 While building this 10% Private Credit allocation (which in general takes a few years) we propose investors pay attention to the current value offered in traded credit. We see some compelling relative value in CLO liabilities for example, which can be used as a bridge to get to the 10% Private Credit allocation.  
 5 
 Institutional and individual investors may look for different ways to implement our views. Draw-down funds remain compelling options for institutions and high net worth individuals, but we also see some compelling tactical opportunities across BDCs, interval funds, and even some high quality ETFs.  
 So, as we look ahead, we think that long-term investors should not rush back into the 60/40 simply based on performance. Rather, we continue to advocate for some form of a more diversified portfolio, including our 40/30/30 portfolio framework. There are several considerations that we think are worth highlighting to investors. Most importantly, though, is that we maintain high conviction that the traditional stock-bond correlation will remain challenged over the next 5-7 years. Key to our thinking is that we will have a higher resting heart rate for inflation as well as our belief that larger fiscal deficits will persist in developed economies. Finally, we see Quantitative Tightening as a headwind to the role bonds played in portfolios during the last decade or so. 
 These insights are hugely important, as the bedrock of the 60/40 allocation is the negative correlation between stocks and bonds, allowing Bonds to cushion Equity losses when  
 they occur. As numerous studies have shown and as we have witnessed first-hand this year, higher levels of and uncertainty around inflation play a major role in pushing the stock-bond correlation higher. And as we outline in Question #2 above, even though we think that inflation will cool in 2023, we believe that the stock-bond correlation won’t return to the levels of the past two decades given the structurally inflationary risks that the pandemic has highlighted. Simply relying on bonds to hedge equity holdings in this new macro regime we envision is a suboptimal stance, in our view. Instead, we believe that investors will need to use more of the tools at their disposal to increase the robustness of their portfolio diversification in the challenging macroeconomic environment ahead ( Exhibit 124 ).

 Section IV: Conclusion 
 Truth tends to reveal its highest wisdom in the guise of simplicity . � Friedrich Nietzsche, German philosopher  
 As we peer around the corner to what lies ahead in the global capital markets, we are poised – despite some of the significant cross-currents that we see across the global economy – to enter 2023 with a more constructive tilt. Our basic premise is that it will be easier to navigate inflation’s negative impact on corporate earnings and consumer balance sheets in 2023 than it was to invest with inflation consistently surprising central banks and investors throughout all of 2022. 
 However, making money in 2023 and beyond will not be easy. It will require both patience and courage, and it will require an investor to have a game plan that leverages the type of long-term frameworks that we employ at KKR across asset classes and regions. 
 In terms of deployment preferences, our message is straightforward: Keep It Simple. We have exited TINA (there is no alternative), and as such, one does not need to stretch to make an adequate total return. In terms of where we would lean in, we favor a few things: 
 1.  We retain our bullish bent on collateral-based cash flows . Infrastructure, Real Estate Credit, and many parts of Asset-Based Finance look extremely attractive to us right now. We also like what these types of investments do to a portfolio during a higher interest rate, higher inflation, and higher nominal GDP environment. Most importantly, they provide both income and diversification. 
 2.  In today’s market we heavily favor a ‘solution’ of different Credit products   that can provide both above average yield relative to recent history and some convexity if inflation is peaking . Said differently, we like the high absolute yield and floating rate nature of Private Credit today, but we also like the convexity that Liquid  
 Credit, including High Yield, can potentially provide if rates increases cool.  
 3.  While overall Equity returns are coming down, we think that there is a significant opportunity in small caps. We also like dividend-growing ‘aristocratic’ equities that have good capital allocators as CEOs . Within Private Equity, we believe strongly in companies with simple unit economics and modest leverage. Cash flow conversion, not big TAMs (total addressable markets) will be the key attribute in this new macroeconomic environment we envision.  
 Importantly, though, across all these asset classes,  our message is to keep it simple , including moving higher up in the capital structure when possible, not over-extending on duration, and focusing on quality. Consistent with this view, we think the reality that many banks are no longer extending credit as freely means that it is a good time to fill that gap and be a lender to high quality counterparties. And within Credit, the good news is that all the dislocations that occurred in 2022 have now created a large number of cost of capital arbitrages that favor investors who understand relative value.  
 In today’s market we heavily fa- vor a ‘solution’ of different Credit products that can provide both above average yield relative to re- cent history and some convexity if inflation is peaking. Said different- ly, we like the high absolute yield and floating rate nature of Private Credit today, but we also like the convexity that Liquid Credit, in- cluding High Yield, can potentially provide if rates increases cool.

 In terms of where we could be wrong on our outlook, our biggest concern is that wage growth keeps the Fed in action for longer than we expect, including the reduction of its balance sheet  (Exhibit 126) . To compensate for this scenario, we continue to advocate for more floating rate debt in the portfolio as well as a large overweight to Real Assets. 
 In closing, we approach 2023 with guarded optimism. We feel confident that the global capital markets – in their currently unsettled state – are providing some very interesting opportunities to investors who understand relative value, and in doing so, know how to invest into some of the cost of capital arbitrages that we are seeing across asset classes and regions these days. Importantly, we believe that it will be the marriage of a steady, top down framework � coupled with sound bottom-up fundamental analysis � that will win the day. Along the way, though, we must remember that simplicity likely trumps complexity in a world of higher rates, stickier inflation, and heightened geopolitical tensions. 
 Consistent with this view, we think the reality that many banks are no longer extending credit as freely means that it is a good time to fill that gap and be a lender to high quality counterparties. And within Credit, the good news is that all the dislocations that oc- curred in 2022 have now created a large number of cost of capital arbitrages that favor investors who understand relative value.

 NZD Citi views & strategy Bias/ Forecasts/ Key levels 
 Citi FX outlook 
 NZDUSD remains mainly driven by China dynamics and global risk sentiment. If the NZ economy substantially slows down in H1’23 with the RBNZ hiking into economic weakness , the market will likely price a pivot earlier than the RBNZ signals it, weighing on NZD. As a result, AUD is likely to outperform NZD during the forecast horizon. A bullish view on NZD though may still be expressed on selective non USD crosses against GBP.

 Citi FX outlook 
 In the short term, we see another leg higher in USDCAD as equity performance is likely to be rocky over the next three months following likely downward EPS revisions in the US. In the long term however, a weaker USD and a more positive environment for global equities may see USDCAD lower. However, we expect relative underperformance vs. other commodity exporters given structural ties to the US economy, where the base case is for a recession in H2 2023.

 GBP Citi views & strategy Bias/ Forecasts/ Key levels 
 Citi FX outlook 
 On growth, the UK lags with the slowest recovery to pre pandemic levels of real GDP. Inbound M&A also remains weaker than the global trend which likely represents a loss of confidence in the future of UK’s business model in a post Brexit world. The sole main upside risk to GBP comes from global risk on via a US soft landing combining with Europe and China bottoming.

 Soft data in Europe has bottomed indicating a much shallower downturn in Europe than earlier feared. China reopening is the big kicker to the European outlook. If ZC is abandoned, then EUR may be a big beneficiary as the German industrial and autos sector is directly linked to Chinese activity. Citi analysts expect ECB rates to move to 3% but risks are to the upside. This works in favor of EUR.

 Citi FX outlook 
 There are a number of factors which may drive USD lower through 2023. First the US is expected to enter into recession, at a time where Europe may be recovering and China expected to have exited from ZC policy. USD performance is likely to be much more subdued (and mostly negative) in a US only recession. Second, when global leading indicators (ex US) turn higher, there is meaningful USD depreciation over the following 12 months. There is likely to be greater volatility in rates and FX over the current quarter that sees in DXY in a 100- 108.00 range. For H2’2023 however DXY may be back to 95.00-96.00.

 Important Disclosure on High Yield Bonds  
 Unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities typically offer a higher yield than investment grade Debt Securities, but also present greater risks with respect to liquidity, volatility, and non-payment of principal and interest. As a result of being classified as non investment grade Debt Securities, these Debt Securities present a greater degree of credit risk relative to many other fixed income Debt Securities. Higher Credit Risk – Unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities generally have predominantly speculative characteristics with respect to the issuer’s capacity to pay interest and repay principal. There is greater risk of non-payment of interest and loss of principal. Many issuers of these Debt Securities have experienced substantial difficulties in servicing their debt obligations, which has led to default and restructurings. The issuers of these Debt Securities generally have to pay a higher rate of interest than investment grade Debt Securities. Higher Liquidity and Secondary Market Risk – The markets in which unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities are traded are generally more limited than those in which investment grade Debt Securities are traded. This lack of liquidity may make it more difficult to resell these Debt Securities and obtain market quotations. Downgrade Risk – Downgrades in the credit rating of unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities by rating agencies are generally accompanied by declines in the market value of these Debt Securities. In some circumstances, investors in the unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities market may anticipate such downgrades as a result of these credits being placed on “credit watch” by rating agencies, causing volatility and speculation of further credit deterioration. Higher Vulnerability to economic cycles - During economic downturns, unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities are typically more susceptible to price volatility and fall more in value than investment grade Debt Securities as i) investors may reevaluate holdings in lower-quality bonds in favor of investment-grade corporate Debt Securities; ii) investors become more risk averse; and iii) default risk rises.  This is often referred to a “flight to quality”. Event Risk – This includes any of a variety of events that can adversely affect the issuer of unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities, and therefore the issuer’s ability to meet debt service obligations to repay principal and interest to Debt Securities holders. Event risk may pertain to the issuer specifically, the industry or business sector of the issuer, or generally upon the overall economy. It could have a direct or indirect impact on the issuer and their outstanding debts. 
 Important Disclosure on RMB 
 Risk relating to RMB – If you choose RMB as the base currency or the alternate currency, you should also note the following: RMB is currently not freely convertible through banks in Hong Kong. Due to exchange controls and/or restrictions imposed on the convertibility, utilization or transferability of RMB (if any) which in turn is affected by, amongst other things, the PRC government's control, there is no guarantee that disruption in the transferability, convertibility or liquidity of RMB will not occur. There is thus a likelihood that you may not be able to convert RMB received into other freely convertible currencies. CNH exchange rates and CNY exchange rates are currently quoted in different markets with different exchange rates, whereby their exchange rate movements may not be in the same direction or magnitude. Therefore, the CNH exchange rate may be different from the CNY exchange rate.

 • The debt ceiling outcome overall may not change the medium to longer term negative outlook for DXY. The bottom line for DXY is to fade any further gains > 104.50. 
 • Japanese fundamentals also make a strong case for limited Yen weakness-(1) Japan’s terms of trade having decisively bottomed around mid-August 2022 from the spike in global energy prices; (2) the rising probability of a shift in the BoJ’s stance on YCC at its June meeting; (3) BoJ’s balance sheet now reducing at a faster pace than the Fed.

 • We now expect a final 25bp rate hike in June for a terminal rate of 4.75 % after which potential for undershoots on headline inflation alongside unemployment and signs of accelerating policy pass through could drive BoE to pause in August. 
 • Meanwhile, UK GDP unexpectedly contracts in March by 0.3% MM which is significantly below the 0% MM consensus forecast. . The medium to longer term view does not get any better for sterling from UK’s high external vulnerabilities.

 NZD’s recent outperformance on non-USD crosses looks unsustainable  as – (1) NZ financial conditions at their most restrictive within the G10 sharply raise odds of an extended hard landing for the NZ economy; (2) next 25bp RBNZ hike is likely the last; and (3) strengthening Chinese recovery lifts Australia’s broad balance of payments relative to NZ and better supports other currencies closely linked to China’s recovery (EUR, AUD, CNH) and JPY as BoJ normalizes policy.

 BoC will likely raise rates again if inflation looks persistently high. any tactical CAD strength on the back of a BoC 25bp hike is unlikely to sustain. Fade CAD gains from next (and last) BoC  hike - with BoC’s rates cycle most closely aligned to the Fed from the strong linkages of the Canadian economy to US via the export channel, an eventual dovish pivot from Fed would likely see BoC doing the same with a 3-4 month lag, leaving USDCAD largely range-bound (1.30 – 1.36) during H2’23.

 Ongoing price pressures across the services sector continue to keep RBA on a firm tightening bias. Citi analysts push RBA rate hike expectation from June to August to give it more time to assess its reaction function towards wages, inflation and the labor market. This should underpin strong support for AUDUSD at 0.6550 – 0.6600 with a likely acceleration of China’s growth in 2H a medium-term tailwind for AUD, putting it on track for further medium-term gains vs USD (> 0.72-0.74 range in H2’23), NZD, CAD and GBP (economies with much higher rates and higher recession risks than Australia).

 The MPC is likely to pause after a 25bp hike in June until November after which there it could shift towards cuts. This is earlier than what OIS rates are pricing and represents a medium-term headwind for sterling. The medium to longer term view does not get any better for GBP from UK’s external vulnerabilities.

 A break above 1.1100 – 1.1200 resistance looks likely over the medium term as several dynamics favor EURUSD upside – (1) a  resilient euro area banking system vs US; (2) euro area’s relative growth resilience vs US in part, due to China’s recovery – admittedly under some question marks lately but momentum is likely to pick up again in H2; and (3) likely long-lasting divergence in ECB’s policy path vs Fed as market rates price less than half as many rate cuts for ECB than the Fed over a 2-year period.

 Financial instability risks in the Swiss banking system may now see need for more CHF liquidity as the SNB along with the Swiss government walks a fine line between fighting inflation and boosting confidence in the Swiss banking sector. This provides scope for SNB to moderate FX intervention to strengthen CHF and likely leaves CHF range bound vs a weaker DXY over the medium term (0.88 – 0.95) but weaker vs EUR and JPY during H2’2023.

 Japanese fundamentals make a strong case for Yen to find support on 3 grounds – (1) Japan’s terms of trade having decisively bottomed around mid- August 2022; (2) rising probability of a shift in the BoJ’s stance on YCC at its June meeting; (3) BoJ’s balance sheet reducing at a faster pace than the Fed.

 Citi FX outlook 
 DXY’s medium to longer term outlook remains negative – a debt ceiling agreement would almost certainly deliver greater fiscal restraint. Markets are likely to view this as constraining US government’s ability to contain regional banking instability through fiscal means. This may be enough to make Fed pause and lead markets to price more extended Fed rate cuts – representing a greater medium-term headwind for USD.

 Weak import growth points to China’s uneven domestic recovery and a tactical headwind to CNH. China’s low inflation also beckons additional policy support from PBoC which may pose additional near-term headwind to CNH as rate differentials work against the currency, tactically leaving USDCNH on the higher side of its 6.80 – 7.00 range,  but with scope to target the 6.50 – 70 range in the latter part of H2’2023 as Fed pivots towards rate cuts while China’s domestic recovery gathers pace in what is likely to be a highly de-synchronized global business cycle.

 Important Disclosure on High Yield Bonds  
 Unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities typically offer a higher yield than investment grade Debt Securities, but also present greater risks with respect to liquidity, volatility, and non-payment of principal and interest. As a result of being classified as non investment grade Debt Securities, these Debt Securities present a greater degree of credit risk relative to many other fixed income Debt Securities. Higher Credit Risk – Unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities generally have predominantly speculative characteristics with respect to the issuer’s capacity to pay interest and repay principal. There is greater risk of non-payment of interest and loss of principal. Many issuers of these Debt Securities have experienced substantial difficulties in servicing their debt obligations, which has led to default and restructurings. The issuers of these Debt Securities generally have to pay a higher rate of interest than investment grade Debt Securities. Higher Liquidity and Secondary Market Risk – The markets in which unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities are traded are generally more limited than those in which investment grade Debt Securities are traded. This lack of liquidity may make it more difficult to resell these Debt Securities and obtain market quotations. Downgrade Risk – Downgrades in the credit rating of unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities by rating agencies are generally accompanied by declines in the market value of these Debt Securities. In some circumstances, investors in the unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities market may anticipate such downgrades as a result of these credits being placed on “credit watch” by rating agencies, causing volatility and speculation of further credit deterioration. Higher Vulnerability to economic cycles - During economic downturns, unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities are typically more susceptible to price volatility and fall more in value than investment grade Debt Securities as i) investors may reevaluate holdings in lower-quality bonds in favor of investment-grade corporate Debt Securities; ii) investors become more risk averse; and iii) default risk rises.  This is often referred to a “flight to quality”. Event Risk – This includes any of a variety of events that can adversely affect the issuer of unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities, and therefore the issuer’s ability to meet debt service obligations to repay principal and interest to Debt Securities holders. Event risk may pertain to the issuer specifically, the industry or business sector of the issuer, or generally upon the overall economy. It could have a direct or indirect impact on the issuer and their outstanding debts. 
 Important Disclosure on RMB 
 Risk relating to RMB – If you choose RMB as the base currency or the alternate currency, you should also note the following: RMB is currently not freely convertible through banks in Hong Kong. Due to exchange controls and/or restrictions imposed on the convertibility, utilization or transferability of RMB (if any) which in turn is affected by, amongst other things, the PRC government's control, there is no guarantee that disruption in the transferability, convertibility or liquidity of RMB will not occur. There is thus a likelihood that you may not be able to convert RMB received into other freely convertible currencies. CNH exchange rates and CNY exchange rates are currently quoted in different markets with different exchange rates, whereby their exchange rate movements may not be in the same direction or magnitude. Therefore, the CNH exchange rate may be different from the CNY exchange rate.

generally upon the overall economy.', 'It could have a direct or indirect impact on the issuer and their outstanding debts.', 'Important Disclosure on RMB Risk relating to RMB If you choose RMB as the base currency or the alternate currency, you should also note the following: RMB is currently not freely convertible through banks in Hong Kong.', ""Due to exchange controls and/or restrictions imposed on the convertibility, utilization or transferability of RMB (if any) which in turn is affected by, amongst other things, the PRC government's control, there is no guarantee that disruption in the transferability, convertibility or liquidity of RMB will not occur."", 'There is thus a likelihood that you may not be able to convert RMB received into other freely convertible currencies.', 'CNH exchange rates and CNY exchange rates are currently quoted in different markets with different exchange rates, whereby their exchange rate movements may not be in the same direction or magnitude.', 'Therefore, the CNH exchange rate may be different from the CNY exchange rate.']"
