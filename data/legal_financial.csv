Prices and availability of financial instruments can be subject to change without notice.,1
Certain high-volatility investments can be subject to sudden and large falls in value that could equal the amount invested.,0
"Important Disclosure on High Yield Bonds Unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities typically offer a higher yield than investment grade Debt Securities, but also present greater risks with respect to liquidity, volatility, and non-payment of principal and interest.",0
"As a result of being classified as non investment grade Debt Securities, these Debt Securities present a greater degree of credit risk relative to many other fixed income Debt Securities.",0
Higher Credit Risk Unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities generally have predominantly speculative characteristics with respect to the issuers capacity to pay interest and repay principal.,1
There is greater risk of non-payment of interest and loss of principal.,1
"Many issuers of these Debt Securities have experienced substantial difficulties in servicing their debt obligations, which has led to default and restructurings.",0
The issuers of these Debt Securities generally have to pay a higher rate of interest than investment grade Debt Securities.,1
Higher Liquidity and Secondary Market Risk The markets in which unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities are traded are generally more limited than those in which investment grade Debt Securities are traded.,1
This lack of liquidity may make it more difficult to resell these Debt Securities and obtain market quotations.,0
Downgrade Risk Downgrades in the credit rating of unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities by rating agencies are generally accompanied by declines in the market value of these Debt Securities.,1
"In some circumstances, investors in the unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities market may anticipate such downgrades as a result of these credits being placed on credit watch by rating agencies, causing volatility and speculation of further credit deterioration.",0
"Higher Vulnerability to economic cycles - During economic downturns, unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities are typically more susceptible to price volatility and fall more in value than investment grade Debt Securities as i) investors may reevaluate holdings in lower-quality bonds in favor of investment-grade corporate Debt Securities; ii) investors become more risk averse; and iii) default risk rises.",0
This is often referred to a flight to quality.,0
"Event Risk This includes any of a variety of events that can adversely affect the issuer of unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities, and therefore the issuers ability to meet debt service obligations to repay principal and interest to Debt Securities holders.",1
"Event risk may pertain to the issuer specifically, the industry or business sector of the issuer, or generally upon the overall economy.",1
It could have a direct or indirect impact on the issuer and their outstanding debts.,1
"Important Disclosure on RMB Risk relating to RMB If you choose RMB as the base currency or the alternate currency, you should also note the following: RMB is currently not freely convertible through banks in Hong Kong.",1
"Due to exchange controls and/or restrictions imposed on the convertibility, utilization or transferability of RMB (if any) which in turn is affected by, amongst other things, the PRC government's control, there is no guarantee that disruption in the transferability, convertibility or liquidity of RMB will not occur.",1
There is thus a likelihood that you may not be able to convert RMB received into other freely convertible currencies.,0
"CNH exchange rates and CNY exchange rates are currently quoted in different markets with different exchange rates, whereby their exchange rate movements may not be in the same direction or magnitude.",1
"Therefore, the CNH exchange rate may be different from the CNY exchange rate.",1

Prices and availability of financial instruments can be subject to change without notice.,1
Certain high-volatility investments can be subject to sudden and large falls in value that could equal the amount invested.,0
"Important Disclosure on High Yield Bonds Unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities typically offer a higher yield than investment grade Debt Securities, but also present greater risks with respect to liquidity, volatility, and non-payment of principal and interest.",0
"As a result of being classified as non investment grade Debt Securities, these Debt Securities present a greater degree of credit risk relative to many other fixed income Debt Securities.",0
Higher Credit Risk Unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities generally have predominantly speculative characteristics with respect to the issuers capacity to pay interest and repay principal.,1
There is greater risk of non-payment of interest and loss of principal.,1
"Many issuers of these Debt Securities have experienced substantial difficulties in servicing their debt obligations, which has led to default and restructurings.",0
The issuers of these Debt Securities generally have to pay a higher rate of interest than investment grade Debt Securities.,1
Higher Liquidity and Secondary Market Risk The markets in which unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities are traded are generally more limited than those in which investment grade Debt Securities are traded.,1
This lack of liquidity may make it more difficult to resell these Debt Securities and obtain market quotations.,0
Downgrade Risk Downgrades in the credit rating of unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities by rating agencies are generally accompanied by declines in the market value of these Debt Securities.,1
"In some circumstances, investors in the unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities market may anticipate such downgrades as a result of these credits being placed on credit watch by rating agencies, causing volatility and speculation of further credit deterioration.",0
"Higher Vulnerability to economic cycles - During economic downturns, unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities are typically more susceptible to price volatility and fall more in value than investment grade Debt Securities as i) investors may reevaluate holdings in lower-quality bonds in favor of investment-grade corporate Debt Securities; ii) investors become more risk averse; and iii) default risk rises.",0
This is often referred to a flight to quality.,0
"Event Risk This includes any of a variety of events that can adversely affect the issuer of unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities, and therefore the issuers ability to meet debt service obligations to repay principal and interest to Debt Securities holders.",1
"Event risk may pertain to the issuer specifically, the industry or business sector of the issuer, or generally upon the overall economy.",1
It could have a direct or indirect impact on the issuer and their outstanding debts.,1
"Important Disclosure on RMB Risk relating to RMB If you choose RMB as the base currency or the alternate currency, you should also note the following: RMB is currently not freely convertible through banks in Hong Kong.",1
"Due to exchange controls and/or restrictions imposed on the convertibility, utilization or transferability of RMB (if any) which in turn is affected by, amongst other things, the PRC government's control, there is no guarantee that disruption in the transferability, convertibility or liquidity of RMB will not occur.",1
There is thus a likelihood that you may not be able to convert RMB received into other freely convertible currencies.,0
"CNH exchange rates and CNY exchange rates are currently quoted in different markets with different exchange rates, whereby their exchange rate movements may not be in the same direction or magnitude.",1
"Therefore, the CNH exchange rate may be different from the CNY exchange rate.",1

ASSET CLASS VIEWS 1.,1
"ECONOMIC GROWTH: On the heels of an aggressive tightening in financial conditions and restrictive monetary policy in 2022, GIR expects global growth to move below trend to 1.8% in 2023.",0
"Investors may be underestimating the resilience of the US economy, which contrasts with a mild recession in Europe and a bumpy reopening in China.",0
"INFLATION: Prices will likely slowly cool, with notable improvement in the policy-critical areas of shelter and wages.",0
"Supply chains have functioned better, with further improvements likely if China implements a more flexible COVID-19 strategy.",0
"Still, wage growth and long-term inflation expectations are likely key factors in forward monetary policy.",0
"MONETARY POLICY: Sticky inflation remains the preeminent global concern, locking central banks (CB) into a pause-over-pivot bias in 2023.",0
"Consequently, CBs are eager to nudge growth below potential.",0
"In the US, GIR expects a terminal rate of 5-5.25% and no cuts in 2023.",0
"In the Euro area and UK, terminal rates may reach 3.00% and 4.50%, respectively.",0
"GEOPOLITICS: Acute geopolitical dynamics remain present as ever, hallmarked by conflict in Ukraine, territorial flexing by China, and entrenched societal polarization.",0
"On the latter, we expect increasing uncertainty in government composition and policy.",0
DM EQUITY: Rising cost of capital should accelerate the transition from highly bifurcated macro to deeply idiosyncratic drivers of return.,0
"To compete with compelling cross-asset opportunities, we believe a focus on profits over revenue, quality over capitalization, and company over country, is warranted.",0
"As current macro risks remain unresolved, a US equity tilt appears warranted, but the attractive cyclicality and potential FX tailwinds of non-US equities may emerge in 2023.",0
THEM EQUITY: THEM equities face a challenging composition of subpar growth and a sharp tightening in financial conditions.,0
"However, we believe pockets of value may exist in EMs that are closer to relief from inflation and rates, including Brazil, Chile, and Korea.",0
"RATES: Global yields will likely move in tandem with CB policy paths, with potential differentiation due to regional energy exposure.",0
"GIR forecasts rates to top out in 1H 2023, though acknowledge the risk to the upside given policymakers willingness to overshoot.",0
"Globally, we believe the deepest level of curve inversion is behind us.",0
8. CREDIT: Credit fundamentals have peaked but remain on solid footing.,0
"US corporates have room for additional spread widening, but disciplined capital management, a low wall of debt maturity, and cash-rich balance sheets may act as buffers.",0
"In Europe, uncertainty around policy and energy pose headwinds despite attractive valuations.",0
CURRENCY: Near-term US dollar strength may persist as global growth risk is to the downside.,0
"Over the longer term, the US dollar looks vulnerable to high valuation and global recovery.",0
"Should the global growth-inflation mix improve, the USD is likely to rebate recent gains.",0
"10. COMMODITIES: Supply challenges are structural, based on years of underinvestment.",0
"While weakness may persist from factors such as higher real rates, USD strength, and recessionary concerns, longer-term physical tightness will not be easily resolved.",0

Point Break We expect 2023 to be a year filled with macro inflection points as inflation and monetary policy pressures start to diminish.,0
"Alongside this transition, we believe investor prioritization of profitability over revenue and sticky income over the uncertainty of capital appreciation will be paramount.",0
"Market opportunities have already reset and investing next year may feature more of 1) stocks with durable cash flows, 2) quality bonds with significant coupons, and 3) alternatives with volatility-reducing attributes.",0

TECH BREAK: The market value loss for mega tech stocks this year is equivalent to the annual GDP of UK or France 8 .,0
"YIELD LAGGARD: A year ago, ~25% of global government debt offered negative nominal yields.",0
"Today, Japan is the last remaining sovereign borrower with negative-yielding debt, comprising <5% of all government debt 8 .",0
COST BENEFIT: Rate volatility has exceeded the 90th percentile relative to the past ten years.,0
"Still, US Treasuries are yielding 5.5x more per unit of volatility than US stocks 8 .",0
DURATION LIMITS: The risk and cost of a rate shock are lower and less punitive today relative to earlier this year.,0
"While a 100 bp rate shock may drag the Bloomberg US Aggregate Bond Index by -6.2%, a coupon offset of 2.7% may ultimately limit left-tail risks 9 .",0

Prices and availability of financial instruments can be subject to change without notice.,1
Certain high-volatility investments can be subject to sudden and large falls in value that could equal the amount invested.,0
"Important Disclosure on High Yield Bonds Unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities typically offer a higher yield than investment grade Debt Securities, but also present greater risks with respect to liquidity, volatility, and non-payment of principal and interest.",0
"As a result of being classified as non investment grade Debt Securities, these Debt Securities present a greater degree of credit risk relative to many other fixed income Debt Securities.",0
Higher Credit Risk Unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities generally have predominantly speculative characteristics with respect to the issuers capacity to pay interest and repay principal.,1
There is greater risk of non-payment of interest and loss of principal.,1
"Many issuers of these Debt Securities have experienced substantial difficulties in servicing their debt obligations, which has led to default and restructurings.",0
The issuers of these Debt Securities generally have to pay a higher rate of interest than investment grade Debt Securities.,1
Higher Liquidity and Secondary Market Risk The markets in which unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities are traded are generally more limited than those in which investment grade Debt Securities are traded.,1
This lack of liquidity may make it more difficult to resell these Debt Securities and obtain market quotations.,0
Downgrade Risk Downgrades in the credit rating of unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities by rating agencies are generally accompanied by declines in the market value of these Debt Securities.,1
"In some circumstances, investors in the unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities market may anticipate such downgrades as a result of these credits being placed on credit watch by rating agencies, causing volatility and speculation of further credit deterioration.",0
"Higher Vulnerability to economic cycles - During economic downturns, unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities are typically more susceptible to price volatility and fall more in value than investment grade Debt Securities as i) investors may reevaluate holdings in lower-quality bonds in favor of investment-grade corporate Debt Securities; ii) investors become more risk averse; and iii) default risk rises.",0
This is often referred to a flight to quality.,0
"Event Risk This includes any of a variety of events that can adversely affect the issuer of unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities, and therefore the issuers ability to meet debt service obligations to repay principal and interest to Debt Securities holders.",1
"Event risk may pertain to the issuer specifically, the industry or business sector of the issuer, or generally upon the overall economy.",1
It could have a direct or indirect impact on the issuer and their outstanding debts.,1
"Important Disclosure on RMB Risk relating to RMB If you choose RMB as the base currency or the alternate currency, you should also note the following: RMB is currently not freely convertible through banks in Hong Kong.",1
"Due to exchange controls and/or restrictions imposed on the convertibility, utilization or transferability of RMB (if any) which in turn is affected by, amongst other things, the PRC government's control, there is no guarantee that disruption in the transferability, convertibility or liquidity of RMB will not occur.",1
There is thus a likelihood that you may not be able to convert RMB received into other freely convertible currencies.,0
"CNH exchange rates and CNY exchange rates are currently quoted in different markets with different exchange rates, whereby their exchange rate movements may not be in the same direction or magnitude.",1
"Therefore, the CNH exchange rate may be different from the CNY exchange rate.",1

 The latest FX forecasts USD: Near-term forecasts are still leaning bearish USD .,0
"RoW LEIs are still turning up, while data momentum has overtaken the US.",0
"DM Earnings Revisions Indices have all recently turned positive, typically a bullish equity signal.",0
This blunts the safe haven appeal of the USD.,0
"Relative rate momentum, looking at 5y nominal US-G9 rates vs 100dMA, still favours RoW.",0
"Excess savings in the UK, EA and Japan are higher than in the US as a % of GDP.",0
" Big picture, Citi analysts still like USD lower.",0
The convergence trade and subsequent asset reallocation away from the US still makes sense and are already evident in Citi data momentum spreads and equity fund flow data.,0
 EUR: China risks are concerning but European recovery has other supports .,0
The 2022 terms of trade shock continues to unwind with European gas prices reaching new cyclical lows.,0
Real wages in Europe continue to trend up while excess savings remain at the highs.,0
"This also suggests the European recovery can be endogenously consumption lead, rather than reliant on Chinese growth.",0
"EUR arguably looks like a next best alternative to USD for reserve managers, where USD allocations have been on downwards trends for the majority of the last decade.",0
" JPY: Citi analysts see risk that USDJPY goes sideways for the next quarter , as global recession pricing looks vulnerable which can lead yields higher, pressuring JPY.",0
"Longer term, Citi analysts expect a US recession in Q4 and risk of a BoJ policy shift around the same time.",0
"The combination of a material US duration rally, and potentially higher Japanese yields, would dramatically narrow the USD-JPY rate differential.",0
"Given uncertainty around the depth of the US recession and signs that the US labour market may be stronger for longer, the 6-12m forecast was upgraded to 125 from 120.",0
" AUD: Weaker China, lower commodity prices and doubtful RBA hawkishness to weigh on AUD .",0
"Domestically, employment data showed labour markets slowing faster than the RBA forecasts.",0
This adds reasons for RBA to hold and see this summer.,0
Citi analysts now moved their final hike to August.,0
"Citi analysts watch closely for any meaningful support from Chinese authorities or credit easing announcement, as a sentiment shift would be hawkish AUD and commodity-linked FX.",0
" GBP: UK data improving, BoE want to pivot but data is not weak enough yet.",0
"The UK has experienced a very positive terms of trade shock, and excess savings in the UK are larger than in US or EA.",0
This could mean that macro divergences between UK and DM peers take longer to set in.,0
Relative data surprise and nominal rate differentials have been a good signpost for these trends.,0
"Both have supported the recent GBP rally on the crosses, amid fairly bearish sentiment across the board on the UK.",0
"In the longer term, Citi anlaysts still think that domestic fragilities in the UK remain in the forecast horizon, which brings on balance larger risk of growth and monetary policy divergences in favour of Europe.",0

The ECB may continue to follow the data dependency approach.,0
" Ultimately, the medium term story for EUR vs USD remains solidly positive on numerous fronts (1) euro areas relative growth resilience versus the US with the OCIS team expecting euro zone to avoid a recession altogether whereas the US is expected to face one later this year ; and (2) a likely pronounced and long-lasting divergence in the ECBs monetary policy path with the Fed as OIS rates price a much more rapid Fed easing cycle than the ECB.",0

 The medium-term outlook may see NZD finding support vs USD from a combination of a strengthening Chinese economy and rising prospect for Fed rate cuts later this year that could lift the pair to 0.66 0.67 level during H2.,0
 But NZDs recent outperformance on non-USD crosses looks unsustainable as NZ financial conditions at their most restrictive within the G10 sharply raise the odds of an extended hard landing.,0

 FX Snapshot NZD Citi views & strategy Bias/ Forecasts/ Key levels Citi FX outlook NZDUSD remains mainly driven by China dynamics and global risk sentiment.,0
"If the NZ economy substantially slows down in H123 with the RBNZ hiking into economic weakness , the market will likely price a pivot earlier than the RBNZ signals it, weighing on NZD.",0
"As a result, AUD is likely to outperform NZD during the forecast horizon.",0
A bullish view on NZD though may still be expressed on selective non USD crosses against GBP.,0
"Previously NZDUSD: 0 3mths: 0.60 NZDUSD: 6 12mths: 0.66 NZDUSD: Longer term: 0.67 Currently (as of Jan): NZDUSD: 0 3mths: 0.62 NZDUSD: 6 12mths: 0.66 NZDUSD: Longer term: 0.67 6-12mths: Moderately bullish NZD vs USD, bearish vs EUR and AUD CAD Citi views & strategy Bias/ Forecasts/ Key levels Citi FX outlook In the short term, we see another leg higher in USDCAD as equity performance is likely to be rocky over the next three months following likely downward EPS revisions in the US.",0
"In the long term however, a weaker USD and a more positive environment for global equities may see USDCAD lower.",0
"However, we expect relative underperformance vs. other commodity exporters given structural ties to the US economy, where the base case is for a recession in H2 2023.",0

"The medium to longer term outlook is bullish AUD, where China reopening benefits may be combined with the likelihood of a more positive backdrop for risk assets and a softer USD.",0

" FX Snapshot GBP Citi views & strategy Bias/ Forecasts/ Key levels Citi FX outlook On growth, the UK lags with the slowest recovery to pre pandemic levels of real GDP.",0
Inbound M&A also remains weaker than the global trend which likely represents a loss of confidence in the future of UKs business model in a post Brexit world.,0
The sole main upside risk to GBP comes from global risk on via a US soft landing combining with Europe and China bottoming.,0

China reopening is the big kicker to the European outlook.,0
"If ZC is abandoned, then EUR may be a big beneficiary as the German industrial and autos sector is directly linked to Chinese activity.",0

 FX Snapshot USD Citi views & strategy Bias/ Forecasts/ Key levels Citi FX outlook There are a number of factors which may drive USD lower through 2023.,0
"First the US is expected to enter into recession, at a time where Europe may be recovering and China expected to have exited from ZC policy.",0
USD performance is likely to be much more subdued (and mostly negative) in a US only recession.,0
"Second, when global leading indicators (ex US) turn higher, there is meaningful USD depreciation over the following 12 months.",0
There is likely to be greater volatility in rates and FX over the current quarter that sees in DXY in a 100- 108.00 range.,0

"As a result of being classified as non investment grade Debt Securities, these Debt Securities present a greater degree of credit risk relative to many other fixed income Debt Securities.",0
Higher Credit Risk Unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities generally have predominantly speculative characteristics with respect to the issuers capacity to pay interest and repay principal.,1
There is greater risk of non-payment of interest and loss of principal.,1
"Many issuers of these Debt Securities have experienced substantial difficulties in servicing their debt obligations, which has led to default and restructurings.",0
The issuers of these Debt Securities generally have to pay a higher rate of interest than investment grade Debt Securities.,1
Higher Liquidity and Secondary Market Risk The markets in which unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities are traded are generally more limited than those in which investment grade Debt Securities are traded.,1
This lack of liquidity may make it more difficult to resell these Debt Securities and obtain market quotations.,0
Downgrade Risk Downgrades in the credit rating of unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities by rating agencies are generally accompanied by declines in the market value of these Debt Securities.,1
"In some circumstances, investors in the unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities market may anticipate such downgrades as a result of these credits being placed on credit watch by rating agencies, causing volatility and speculation of further credit deterioration.",0
"Higher Vulnerability to economic cycles - During economic downturns, unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities are typically more susceptible to price volatility and fall more in value than investment grade Debt Securities as i) investors may reevaluate holdings in lower-quality bonds in favor of investment-grade corporate Debt Securities; ii) investors become more risk averse; and iii) default risk rises.",0

"US inflation seems to have peaked, with a the primary contributor of energy costs having dropped dramatically vs 2022 highs.",0

 FX Snapshot NZD Citi views & strategy Bias/ Forecasts/ Key levels Citi FX outlook NZDUSD remains mainly driven by China dynamics and global risk sentiment.,0
"If the NZ economy substantially slows down in H123 with the RBNZ hiking into economic weakness , the market will likely price a pivot earlier than the RBNZ signals it, weighing on NZD.",0
"As a result, AUD is likely to outperform NZD during the forecast horizon.",0
A bullish view on NZD though may still be expressed on selective non USD crosses against GBP.,0
"Previously NZDUSD: 0 3mths: 0.60 NZDUSD: 6 12mths: 0.66 NZDUSD: Longer term: 0.67 Currently (as of Jan): NZDUSD: 0 3mths: 0.62 NZDUSD: 6 12mths: 0.66 NZDUSD: Longer term: 0.67 6-12mths: Moderately bullish NZD vs USD, bearish vs EUR and AUD CAD Citi views & strategy Bias/ Forecasts/ Key levels Citi FX outlook In the short term, we see another leg higher in USDCAD as equity performance is likely to be rocky over the next three months following likely downward EPS revisions in the US.",0
"In the long term however, a weaker USD and a more positive environment for global equities may see USDCAD lower.",0
"However, we expect relative underperformance vs. other commodity exporters given structural ties to the US economy, where the base case is for a recession in H2 2023.",0
"Previously USDCAD: 0 3mth: 1.40 USDCAD: 6 12mth: 1.25 USDCAD: LT: 1.25 Currently (as of Jan): USDCAD: 0 3mth: 1.40 USDCAD: 6 12mth: 1.30 USDCAD: LT: 1.25 6-12mths: Bullish CAD vs USD, moderately bearish vs EUR Commodity Blocs AUD Citi views & strategy Bias/ Forecasts/ Key levels Citi FX outlook An earlier than expected China reopening is supportive for AUD.",0
"The medium to longer term outlook is bullish AUD, where China reopening benefits may be combined with the likelihood of a more positive backdrop for risk assets and a softer USD.",0
"By H223, AUDs outperformance may broaden to include more crosses (including USD).",0
"Previously AUDUSD: 0 3mths: 0.64 AUDUSD: 6 12mths: 0.74 AUDUSD: LT: 0.76 Currently (as of Jan): AUDUSD: 0 3mths: 0.68 AUDUSD: 6 12mths: 0.74 AUDUSD: LT: 0.76 6-12mths: Bullish AUD vs USD, neutral vs EUR",0
" FX Snapshot GBP Citi views & strategy Bias/ Forecasts/ Key levels Citi FX outlook On growth, the UK lags with the slowest recovery to pre pandemic levels of real GDP.",0
Inbound M&A also remains weaker than the global trend which likely represents a loss of confidence in the future of UKs business model in a post Brexit world.,0
The sole main upside risk to GBP comes from global risk on via a US soft landing combining with Europe and China bottoming.,0
"Previously GBPUSD: 0 3mth: 1.10 GBPUSD: 6 12mth: 1.26 GBPUSD: LT: 1.28 Currently (as of Jan): GBPUSD: 0 3mth: 1.17 GBPUSD: 6 12mth: 1.25 GBPUSD: LT: 1.34 6 12mths: Bullish GBP vs USD, bearish vs EUR European Currencies EUR Citi views & strategy Bias/ Forecasts/ Key levels Citi FX outlook Soft data in Europe has bottomed indicating a much shallower downturn in Europe than earlier feared.",0
China reopening is the big kicker to the European outlook.,0
"If ZC is abandoned, then EUR may be a big beneficiary as the German industrial and autos sector is directly linked to Chinese activity.",0
Citi analysts expect ECB rates to move to 3% but risks are to the upside.,0
This works in favor of EUR.,0

" FX Snapshot CHF Citi views & strategy Bias/ Forecasts/ Key levels Citi FX outlook In the LT, we expect the rebound in EU growth to continue and for the gap to Swiss growth to widen, which prompts CHF underperformance vs EUR.",0
SNB may allow negative rate differentials against ECB to expand and for CHF to weaken vs EUR to support exports.,0
"However, in the ST, a potential pullback in risk assets may keep EURCHF pinned near current levels.",0

H223 though may see more sustained gains in JPY to 110-115 may Fed pivot toward rate cuts.,0
"Previously USDJPY: 0 3mths: 137.0 USDJPY: 6 12mths: 133.0 USDJPY: LT: 139.0 Currently (as of Jan): USDJPY: 0 3mths: 134.0 USDJPY: 6 12mths: 120.0 USDJPY: LT: 130.0 6-12mths: bullish JPY vs USD, moderately bullish vs EUR Safe-haven Currencies",0
 FX Snapshot USD Citi views & strategy Bias/ Forecasts/ Key levels Citi FX outlook There are a number of factors which may drive USD lower through 2023.,0
"First the US is expected to enter into recession, at a time where Europe may be recovering and China expected to have exited from ZC policy.",0
USD performance is likely to be much more subdued (and mostly negative) in a US only recession.,0
"Second, when global leading indicators (ex US) turn higher, there is meaningful USD depreciation over the following 12 months.",0
There is likely to be greater volatility in rates and FX over the current quarter that sees in DXY in a 100- 108.00 range.,0
For H22023 however DXY may be back to 95.00-96.00.,0

"However, Chinas current account normalization may limit RMBs upside.",0
"USDCNH may eventually end lower by 2023 end as DXY weakens more sustainably during H223, it is difficult to see CNH surpassing JPY in performance vs USD while also noting Chinas growth proxies (AUD and SGD) have shown more resilience until most recently.",0

Certain high-volatility investments can be subject to sudden and large falls in value that could equal the amount invested.,0
"Important Disclosure on High Yield Bonds Unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities typically offer a higher yield than investment grade Debt Securities, but also present greater risks with respect to liquidity, volatility, and non-payment of principal and interest.",0
"As a result of being classified as non investment grade Debt Securities, these Debt Securities present a greater degree of credit risk relative to many other fixed income Debt Securities.",0
Higher Credit Risk Unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities generally have predominantly speculative characteristics with respect to the issuers capacity to pay interest and repay principal.,1
There is greater risk of non-payment of interest and loss of principal.,1
"Many issuers of these Debt Securities have experienced substantial difficulties in servicing their debt obligations, which has led to default and restructurings.",0
The issuers of these Debt Securities generally have to pay a higher rate of interest than investment grade Debt Securities.,1
Higher Liquidity and Secondary Market Risk The markets in which unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities are traded are generally more limited than those in which investment grade Debt Securities are traded.,1
This lack of liquidity may make it more difficult to resell these Debt Securities and obtain market quotations.,0
Downgrade Risk Downgrades in the credit rating of unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities by rating agencies are generally accompanied by declines in the market value of these Debt Securities.,1
"In some circumstances, investors in the unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities market may anticipate such downgrades as a result of these credits being placed on credit watch by rating agencies, causing volatility and speculation of further credit deterioration.",0
"Higher Vulnerability to economic cycles - During economic downturns, unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities are typically more susceptible to price volatility and fall more in value than investment grade Debt Securities as i) investors may reevaluate holdings in lower-quality bonds in favor of investment-grade corporate Debt Securities; ii) investors become more risk averse; and iii) default risk rises.",0
This is often referred to a flight to quality.,0
"Event Risk This includes any of a variety of events that can adversely affect the issuer of unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities, and therefore the issuers ability to meet debt service obligations to repay principal and interest to Debt Securities holders.",1
"Event risk may pertain to the issuer specifically, the industry or business sector of the issuer, or generally upon the overall economy.",1
It could have a direct or indirect impact on the issuer and their outstanding debts.,1
"Important Disclosure on RMB Risk relating to RMB If you choose RMB as the base currency or the alternate currency, you should also note the following: RMB is currently not freely convertible through banks in Hong Kong.",1
"Due to exchange controls and/or restrictions imposed on the convertibility, utilization or transferability of RMB (if any) which in turn is affected by, amongst other things, the PRC government's control, there is no guarantee that disruption in the transferability, convertibility or liquidity of RMB will not occur.",1
There is thus a likelihood that you may not be able to convert RMB received into other freely convertible currencies.,0
"CNH exchange rates and CNY exchange rates are currently quoted in different markets with different exchange rates, whereby their exchange rate movements may not be in the same direction or magnitude.",1
"Therefore, the CNH exchange rate may be different from the CNY exchange rate.",1

" Fixed Income MUSINGS FIXED INCOME Goldman Sachs Asset Management 1 July 29, 2022 POLICY PICTURE The Fed appears to have concluded the expeditious phase of its tightening cycle, delivering a 75bps rate hike to take the policy rate to their own neutral estimate of 2.25- 2.5%.",0
"Markets responded favourably in anticipation of a slower pace of tightening ahead (see Chart) given a loss of growth momentum, emerging signs of easing inflation pressures and the Feds emphasis on data dependence going forward (see quote).",0
"Overall, we think the outlook for Fed policy has turned more balanced.",0
"We expect a further rate increase in September, with the hike increment being guided by key data releases such as the employment cost index, PCE inflation and measures of consumer inflation expectations.",0
"Thereafter, we think signs of softening in both the labour market and inflation outturns could see the Fed pause to assess the impact of this years rapid tightening.",0
"After all, the Fed has raised rates by 2.25% in just five months.",0
"Notwithstanding the growing accumulation of evidence on weaker growth prospects for the second half of the year, policymakers appear to be retaining a glass-half-full assessment of the economy.",0
"During the post-meeting press conference Fed Chair Jerome Powell said he does not think the US is currently in recession as there are just too many areas of the economy that are performing too well. Meanwhile, US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen highlighted the creation of almost 400,000 jobs a month is not a recession and that a recession would require a broad- based weakening of the economy which is inconsistent with recent data.",0
"Past performance does not guarantee future results, which may vary.",1

" Fixed Income MUSINGS Goldman Sachs Asset Management 2 FIXED INCOME July 29, 2022 MACRO AT A GLANCE Economic data has turned more mixed and is not consistently supportive of rapid monetary tightening.",0
"For example, flash composite PMI readings for July were in contractionary territory in the US and Euro Area (see Chart).",0
Weakness on the services side of the economy likely reflects the cost-of-living crisis and indicates the post- Omicron rebound is behind us.,0
"In Europe, high inflation continues to weigh on sentiment with the German ifo Business Climate index falling to its lowest level since June 2020.",0
"Meanwhile, the US economy experienced its second consecutive quarter of negative GDP growth.",0
"With nonfarm payroll growth averaging 375,000 during the second quarter and GDP data subject to revisions, we do not think the economy was in a recession in the first half of the year, however, we acknowledge risks are building.",0
NAVIGATING FIXED INCOME A bad news is good news dynamic has emerged whereby signs of slowing growth and easing inflation pressures provides some relief for markets due to reduced risks of policy overtightening.,0
"That said, within fixed income sectors, bouts of weakness in lower-quality bonds reflects growing growth concerns (see Chart).",0
We used recent strength in high yield corporate credit as an opening to scale back our exposure.,0
"Overall, we remain overweight corporate bonds given continued strength in corporate balance sheet positions.",0
"However, we are mindful of downbeat signals from second quarter earnings releases, including signs of slowing consumer demand owing to inflation pressures.",0

Certain high-volatility investments can be subject to sudden and large falls in value that could equal the amount invested.,0
"Important Disclosure on High Yield Bonds Unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities typically offer a higher yield than investment grade Debt Securities, but also present greater risks with respect to liquidity, volatility, and non-payment of principal and interest.",0
"As a result of being classified as non investment grade Debt Securities, these Debt Securities present a greater degree of credit risk relative to many other fixed income Debt Securities.",0
Higher Credit Risk Unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities generally have predominantly speculative characteristics with respect to the issuers capacity to pay interest and repay principal.,1
There is greater risk of non-payment of interest and loss of principal.,1
"Many issuers of these Debt Securities have experienced substantial difficulties in servicing their debt obligations, which has led to default and restructurings.",0
The issuers of these Debt Securities generally have to pay a higher rate of interest than investment grade Debt Securities.,1
Higher Liquidity and Secondary Market Risk The markets in which unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities are traded are generally more limited than those in which investment grade Debt Securities are traded.,1
This lack of liquidity may make it more difficult to resell these Debt Securities and obtain market quotations.,0
Downgrade Risk Downgrades in the credit rating of unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities by rating agencies are generally accompanied by declines in the market value of these Debt Securities.,1
"In some circumstances, investors in the unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities market may anticipate such downgrades as a result of these credits being placed on credit watch by rating agencies, causing volatility and speculation of further credit deterioration.",0
"Higher Vulnerability to economic cycles - During economic downturns, unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities are typically more susceptible to price volatility and fall more in value than investment grade Debt Securities as i) investors may reevaluate holdings in lower-quality bonds in favor of investment-grade corporate Debt Securities; ii) investors become more risk averse; and iii) default risk rises.",0
This is often referred to a flight to quality.,0
"Event Risk This includes any of a variety of events that can adversely affect the issuer of unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities, and therefore the issuers ability to meet debt service obligations to repay principal and interest to Debt Securities holders.",1
"Event risk may pertain to the issuer specifically, the industry or business sector of the issuer, or generally upon the overall economy.",1
It could have a direct or indirect impact on the issuer and their outstanding debts.,1
"Important Disclosure on RMB Risk relating to RMB If you choose RMB as the base currency or the alternate currency, you should also note the following: RMB is currently not freely convertible through banks in Hong Kong.",1
"Due to exchange controls and/or restrictions imposed on the convertibility, utilization or transferability of RMB (if any) which in turn is affected by, amongst other things, the PRC government's control, there is no guarantee that disruption in the transferability, convertibility or liquidity of RMB will not occur.",1
There is thus a likelihood that you may not be able to convert RMB received into other freely convertible currencies.,0
"CNH exchange rates and CNY exchange rates are currently quoted in different markets with different exchange rates, whereby their exchange rate movements may not be in the same direction or magnitude.",1
"Therefore, the CNH exchange rate may be different from the CNY exchange rate.",1

" WWW.KKR.COM 3 INSIGHTS: OUTLOOK FOR 2023: KEEP IT SIMPLE Despite all the uncertainty across todays global capital markets, we are poised to enter 2023 with a more constructive tilt, especially on many parts of Credit.",0
Our basic premise is that it will be easier to navigate inflations negative impact on corporate earnings and consumer balance sheets in 2023 than it was to invest with inflation continually surprising central banks and investors in 2022.,0
"However, what we are proposing will require both patience and courage and a game plan that leverages the type of long-term frameworks we employ at KKR across asset classes and regions.",0
"At its core, our message is to Keep it Simple in 2023.",0
"The massive increase we have seen in short-term interest in many instances has created attractive total return opportunities across several parts of the global capital markets without having to stretch on leverage, volatility, and/or risk.",0
Implicit in our outlook is our strong view that now is a good time to be a lender.,0
"As such, we continue to lean towards collateral-based cash flows such as Infrastructure, Private Credit, Real Estate Credit and many parts of Asset-Based Finance.",0
We also like some of the convexity that liquid Credit provides after the recent sell-off.,0
"Within Equities, our advice is to shift away from larger- capitalization Technology stocks in favor of smaller capitalization names with better valuation profiles.",0
History suggests that 2023 will be a good vintage year for Private Equity.,0
"We also see the YOU.S. dollars strength reversing, which means that many international assets need to be re- considered.",0
"Finally, while we see the positive relationship between stocks and bonds easing in 2023, our longer-term view remains that we have entered a regime change that requires a different approach to overall global macro and asset allocation.",0
"Truth is ever to be found in the simplicity, and not in the multiplicity and confusion of things.",1
"Isaac Newton, English mathematician and physicist Outlook for 2023: Keep It Simple",0
" 4 WWW.KKR.COM INSIGHTS: OUTLOOK FOR 2023: KEEP IT SIMPLE With a higher resting heart rate for inflation amidst record stimu- lus, we have been cautioning for some time that we see a dif- ferent kind of recovery, and that investors should walk, not run when it comes to deployment, especially as the correlation be- tween stocks and bonds turned positive.",0
"No doubt, we still think the macro environment remains challenging, but we now feel more emboldened as we think about deployment entering 2023.",0
"Key to our thinking are the following considerations 1 Global central banks are much further along in their tightening campaign , As Chairman Powell said recently, rates are getting close to sufficiently restrictive levels.",0
"Our work shows that the share of the top 25 central banks boosting rates will fall to 12% in 2023, compared to fully 84% in 2022.",0
"This decline is an important one to consider, we believe.",0
We also think the chance of the YOU.S. dollar bull market continuing well into 2023 is now much more limited.,0
"This macro consideration is a big deal, in our view 2 United States inflation has peaked , though it remains quite high.",0
"In fact, with this publication, we just tweaked our inflation forecast lower for the first time in almost two years.",0
"See below for more detail, but a tug of war between falling housing prices and rising labor costs now better reflects the Feds intentions to cool the economy.",0
"3 Capital markets new supply (i.e., new issuance), which we track closely as a proxy for calling bottoms, has dwindled essentially to nothing .",0
"In the United States, for example, we measure that it is now approaching the lows we saw in 2009, especially when one adjusts for the growth in GDP since then (Exhibit 1) .",0
4 A more visible hand: We think government spending will quietly surprise on the upside in 2023 .,0
"Our travels to major political hubs such as Washington DC, Paris, and Tokyo of late lead us to believe that key initiatives like the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA, which we think could be closer to $700 billion versus the headline of $370 billion) and EU Recovery Budget (€1.8 trillion over 2020-2026) will result in more spending than many folks think.",0
"Meanwhile, spending on military budgets is increasing around the world, as geopolitics is no longer a discretionary line item in most government budgets these days.",0
"Finally, in China, for example, our local research leads us to believe that further stimulus is gaining momentum to offset the headwinds created by recent property developer defaults.",0
5 The technical picture is actually quite compelling .,0
"Many allocators have de-risked their portfolios, especially allocators who likely over-emphasized the stability provided by bonds as we transitioned from QE to QT.",0
"We also take comfort that the S&P 500 has already corrected 25%, an important lean in signal based on history, as well as that most High Yield bonds now trade at 85 cents on the dollar, another signal that one should add back some risks to a diversified portfolio.",0
"Importantly, our view is that the massive adjustment in the risk-free rate, not necessarily a record widening of credit spreads, will be what is remembered about the opportunity set created during this tightening cycle.",0
" WWW.KKR.COM 5 INSIGHTS: OUTLOOK FOR 2023: KEEP IT SIMPLE So, after what we believe will be a dismal earnings season in January, we think investors should accelerate to at least a jog from a walk in terms of deployment budgeting for 2023 as well as lean more aggressively into the periodic bouts of dislocation we continue to forecast during the next 12-18 months .",0
"Simply stated, the recession fears we face in 2023 are likely less ominous and more in the price than the inflation fears that surprised markets in 2022.",0
"To be clear, though, we are not advocating a full risk-on approach like we did after COVID roiled the markets.",0
"So, our call to arms is not to buy the market with abandon.",0
"Rather, it is to be selective within and across asset classes.",1
Key to our thinking is that: 1.,0
"Earnings estimates are still too high , and falling unit volume in recent months will become more apparent as inflation cools.",0
"European earnings, in particular, look to be at risk in the first half of 2023.",0
Some parts of the market still need to correct .,0
"Large cap old economy Technology stocks, for example, are still over-owned by both institutions and individuals.",0
This reality is also occurring at a time of increased competition and regulatory oversight.,0
"Looking ahead, we see Technology being less than 20% of the S&P 500 weighting within the next few years, compared to what we think was a peak of 29.1% in 4Q21.",0
See below for details on our analysis.,1
"There are still some spicy capital structures, debt in particular, in challenged sectors of the economy that will be tested in the slower growth and higher rate environment we envision.",0
"Negative operating leverage, layering of old debt with new debt (a product of weak documentation during the go-go years), and refinancing risks will all be important issues to sidestep in 2023, we believe.",0
We still do not fully understand QT .,1
"The European and the YOU.S. central banks both want to shrink the size of their massive balance sheets, which now total 65% and 33%, respectively, of their GDPs.",0
"Translating this reduction into rate hike equivalents feels much more like art than science, and as such, our expectation is that this process takes longer and acts as more of an overhang on liquidity and financial conditions than in prior cycles.",0
"We also forecast that short rates do not come down as fast as the consen- sus expects, given that we see inflation being above the Feds target for at least five years in a row (2021-2025e).",0
"We expect to see some unexpected provisioning around Office Real Estate and non-secured consumer lending in 2023, which could surprise some banks and investors in the coming quarters.",0
"So, against this backdrop, our most important message is to keep it simple and buy simplicity .",0
"Indeed, as Isaac Newton once said, Truth is ever to be found in the simplicity, and not in the multiplicity and confusion of things. We think it is also the time to diversify across multiple asset classes not concentrate ones portfolio the same way one would have during the 2010-2020 period.",0
"If we are right, then Credit makes more sense to own than Equities right now across most asset classes.",0
"Indeed, given that many traditional banks are reining in their lending, now is a good time in many instances to be a provider of capital, especially to businesses that align with our key themes.",0
"Just consider that our S&P 500 target is up only marginally versus current levels, while senior Direct Lending offers returns well north of 10%.",0
"Within Credit, keep it simple.",1
"Specifically, we favor shorter duration, bigger companies, and attractive call protection features.",0
"Further, we also still favor collateral linked to higher nominal GDP growth.",0
"If we are right, then Credit makes more sense to own than Equities right now across most asset classes.",0
"Indeed, given that many traditional banks are reining in their lending, now is a good time in many instances to be a provider of capital, especially to businesses that align with our key themes.",0
 6 WWW.KKR.COM INSIGHTS: OUTLOOK FOR 2023: KEEP IT SIMPLE How Has Our Thinking Evolved Action Item Rate of Change Matters .,1
"While we still see a higher resting heart rate for inflation this cycle, we think that headline inflation peaked in the latter half of 2022.",0
We expect a peak tightening of financial conditions to occur in 2023.,0
We recently lowered our 2023 YOU.S. inflation forecast for the first time in almost two years to 3.9% from 4.8%.,0
"As part of this transition, we expect nominal GDP growth to slow by fully 50% to about four percent in 2023 from 10% in 2022.",0
"As such, we expect the dollar to be less of a headwind to financial conditions in 2023.",0
"We also expect less duration risk for bonds, a notable change in our thinking about asset allocation.",0
"We have higher conviction in our long-held view that earnings will decline in 2023, and we see a lower than normal rebound in EPS in 2024.",0
"This backdrop means creaky capital structures will be under pressure, especially those with challenged margin expectations It is too early to just buy all risk assets across the board.",0
"Rather, an allocator should focus on long-term attractive valuations in key areas such as Small-Cap Equities, unlevered Private Credit, Real Estate Debt, and select parts of High Yield and Investment Grade Debt.",0
Defendable margins will be key across all asset classes.,0
"We are growing more convinced that the worker shortage in the United States is structural in nature, given the intersection of demographic trends and pandemic- related behavioral changes.",0
"All told, in the YOU.S., for example, we think the labor force is missing about four million workers, with only about half likely to return at some point.",0
"So, we concur with Chairman Powells view that the labor market is out of balance. This realization is part of our thesis that structurally higher inflation is the new normal and will be stickier for longer.",0
"We favor automation, digitalization, and family care services, all of which help to address the current labor shortage.",0
We also think it is more important than ever for management teams to be aligned with their workforces.,0
House Prices Under Pressure.,0
Housing is one of the most direct ways that central banks have been able to slow growth.,0
"In the YOU.S., for example, we now forecast home price depreciation of minus five percent in both 2023 and 2024, respectively.",0
"Previously, we had assumed modest home price appreciation in our annual forecasts.",0
Household net worth is falling faster this cycle than any other cycle on record ( Exhibit 27 ).,0
"As such, being right that unemployment does not spike is a key underpinning to our overall macro thesis.",0
"Remember we have unemployment in the YOU.S. increasing trough to peak by 1.4%, compared to an average of 3.7% during recessions.",0
"Goods Deflation, Services Inflation.",0
"We have higher conviction in our goods deflation thesis; at the same time, we believe that inflation has shifted to the services arena and will stay higher for longer.",0
Our long exposures remain much more tilted towards Services than Goods.,0
"We continue to forecast a recession in the Goods sector in 2023, partially offset by an increase in global Services spending.",0
Asynchronous Recovery.,0
It is too simplistic in our view to simply talk about one synchronized global economy.,1
Asias inflation and monetary policy profiles are now wildly different than the Wests.,0
"Meanwhile, the YOU.S. is food and energy independent at a time when Europe and Emerging Markets are experiencing an unprecedented war shock. Despite our view that the YOU.S. dollar is peaking, our models still do not show Emerging Markets as a high conviction Buy.",0
"As such, we continue to favor selectivity across regions.",0
"For example, we like corporate carve-outs in Korea and Japan, and we favor higher growth markets such as India and Vietnam.",0
Real Rates.,1
"Despite near record tightening, we see real rates staying below three percent this cycle.",0
"By comparison, the Fed brought real rates above three percent at least one time each decade from the 1960s through the early 2000s.",0
Our base case has fed funds reaching 5.125% in mid-2023 be- fore settling in at 4.875% by year end.,0
The market is much more bullish on the Fed accelerating rate cuts in late 2023/2024.,0
"Meanwhile, in Europe, we forecast the ECB to boost short rates to 3.5% in 2023 through the end of 2024.",0
We expect a longer- term neutral rate closer to 2.25% in Europe.,0
 WWW.KKR.COM 7 INSIGHTS: OUTLOOK FOR 2023: KEEP IT SIMPLE We also want to mention that 2023 will feel a lot different than 2022.,0
We note the following: 1 The pace of central bank tightening is likely peaking.,0
"The percentage of the top 25 global central banks that will be tightening by the end of 2023 will likely be closer to 12%, compared to around 84% in the fourth quarter of 2022.",0
"2 After surging to double-digit levels post pandemic, we see nominal GDP growth cooling in 2023 .",0
We expect YOU.S. nominal GDP to fall to 4.2% in 2023 from 9.9% in 2022.,0
This is a big drop and likely means that duration becomes less of a cycle risk over the next 12 months.,0
3 We forecast that YOU.S. real wage growth will likely turn positive in 2023.,0
"If we are right and unemployment lags versus other cycles, we do States.",0
not envision a 2008-type downturn in the United 4 We no longer see the USD as a safe haven.,0
"We expect the recent dollar downtrend to continue in 2023, and as such, we are looking for hedges that will perform if the YOU.S. dollar actually weakens further than expected.",0
5 The negative impact of inflation will shift from resetting upward the risk-free rate in 2022 to putting pressure on corporate profits and consumer balance sheets in 2023.,0
"If we are right, then longer-term rates may peak temporarily as earnings disappoint.",0

"True, spreads have not blown out like in 2008, but the risk-free rate now embeds a lot of bad news, and absolute yields look extremely attractive in a world that we think argues for lower overall returns for most portfolios during the next 5-10 years.",0
"At the moment we like high quality municipal bonds, mortgages, CLO IG /A-AAA liabilities, senior direct lending, etc.",1
"See our relative value discussion in SECTION III Question #1 for full details, but we want to be a liquidity provider when others cannot.",1
PICK (NEW) Distinct sector selectivity within public markets .,0
"From a public market sector perspective, we favor Energy, Industrials (including Defense names), and Big Pharma at the expense of Large Cap Technology and any unsecured lending across Financials and/or Consumer sectors.",0
"PICK (NEW) The Russell 2000 is at an attractive entry point for long-term investors, in our view.",0
"All told, the Russell 2000s next 12 months P/E ratio has fallen to 10.8x, its lowest level since 1990 and 30% below its long-term average.",0
"On a relative basis, the Russell 2000s next 12 months P/E is trading at the lowest level versus large-cap stocks since the Tech Bubble.",0
PICK (NEW) International hard assets.,1
"Many global currencies are still on sale, and as such, we think that strategic buyers are going to start shopping overseas for hard assets, especially in the Real Estate and Infrastructure sectors.",0
"Therefore, we believe allocators will need to move quickly to acquire quality Real Estate assets in key metro markets such as London, Paris, and Tokyo.",0
"We also like fiber and data plays across most parts of the world, a theme we have been aggressively playing through our Infrastructure allocations at KKR.",0
"See below for details and Exhibit 2 above, but we view the current period as a unique opportunity where, on a dollar adjusted basis, hard assets in many parts of both Europe and Asia still look quite attractive.",0
" WWW.KKR.COM 13 INSIGHTS: OUTLOOK FOR 2023: KEEP IT SIMPLE PICK (NEW) Cyclical hedges that might work as the dollar weakens, including select THEM and Commodities, such as Oil and Copper.",0
"Our travels and conversations with CIOs lead us to believe that most investors, regardless of region, are overweight dollar-based assets.",0
"This decision has been the right one in recent years, but the technical picture makes us want to add some spice in the form of out of the money copper and/or oil calls, or some beaten down THEM where we like the long-term fundamentals (e.g., Vietnam).",0
PICK (NEW) Dividend yielding and growing Equities.,0
"As those who have followed our work know, we have been advocating owning rising earnings and rising dividend stories over different periods over the last twenty years.",0
"Now is one of those periods, we believe.",0
"To be clear, we do not favor just high dividend yields.",0
"Rather, we favor companies with rising free cash flow that allows them to consistently increase their dividends and earnings per share.",0
"See our note The Uncomfortable Truth for further details, but one could also just buy the Dividend Aristocracy basket and call it a day.",0
"PICK (NEW) Non-correlated assets should be added at the expense of traditional long/short hedge funds, we believe.",0
Too many allocators are still overweight long/short equity funds in their hedge fund portfolios.,0
Our base view is that more CIOs should be concentrating their book in hedge fund managers that can provide non-correlated returns to equity markets.,0
We also think that allocators should align with managers that stay in their lanes in terms of liquidity.,0
"Indeed, as we learned in our recent endowment and foundation survey (see The Times they Are a-Changin ), many CIOs now own illiquid hedge fund portfolios in their liquid books.",0
PICK (NEW) Private Vintages.,1
"As we show in Exhibit 18 , the value of the illiquidity premium tends to increase in bumpy markets.",0
"Linear deployment is essential to portfolio construction in the private markets, and one of our key messages for 2023 is to lean into both Private Equity and Private Credit right now.",0
PAN (NEW) Begin to sell USD.,0
"Despite the USD coming back towards earth in recent weeks, we still think the dollar is overbought and over-owned.",0
"It clearly has been the right call to own dollar assets for several years ( Exhibits 2, 99, and 100 ).",0
"However, we feel that this trade has begun to turn.",0
"We like JPY as a long against the dollar as well as some higher yielding, higher quality THEM currencies.",0

"This sector is valuation challenged at a time when fundamentals, especially around online advertising and social media, are still deteriorating and competition is increasing.",0
"At the same time, we continue to think that globally, greater government regulation of Tech is increasingly on the table at a time when global geopolitical competition is heating up.",0
"See below for details, but once a sector peaks at over 20% of an index, it tends to badly underperform over the next three to five years.",0
"PAN (NEW) Select parts of the Banking sector, particularly those tethered to floating rate mortgages.",1
There are several areas within the financial sector where we expect to see faster than expected deterioration in loan loss provisions.,0
"For starters, we envision tougher sledding for certain financial institutions in Canada and Australia, as many of the mortgages in those countries are floating rate ( Exhibit 14 ).",0
"House prices are also likely to slip further in 2023; at the same time, higher payment rates on mortgages will coincide with slowing nominal GDP growth.",0
"Conversely, Japanese banks would benefit mightily if global GDP does not slow but inflation does ease.",0
"Meanwhile, we think that old parts of commercial office space will likely create some angst as debt for large scale office complexes matures in 2023 and 2024.",0
PAN (SAME) Goods as consumer spending shifts to Services .,0
"As the economy cools and consumers shift their focus back towards experiences over things, we envision that the Goods sector, including the distributors of retail products, could face significant headwinds.",0
" 14 WWW.KKR.COM INSIGHTS: OUTLOOK FOR 2023: KEEP IT SIMPLE as we suggested in our midyear outlook, we still see private label taking aggressive market share from branded products.",0
PAN (NEW) Segments of Commercial Real Estate may face incremental headwinds in 2023.,0
"In our view, certain parts of the traditional Office sector could face challenges in 2023, especially older properties that 1) do not have environmentally friendly footprints; 2) will need to roll their debt at higher rates; and 3) are exposed to sectors that face significant headcount reductions or work from home headwinds (e.g., large parts of the Technology sector).",0
"There is also growing concern that some banks may foreclose on office buildings at reduced prices, which could reset the entire market for commodity office buildings.",0
"Do not get us wrong, though, there are significant opportunities in Office Real Estate and we are actually believers in back to work, but one needs to be eyes wide open that using the old playbook will not yield the same results as in the past.",0
"To this end, we think a significant opportunity exists in buying high quality new assets at discounts to replacement costs in high growth markets, especially as market participants may sell assets to deleverage other parts of their portfolios.",0
"PAN (NEW) Interest rate volatility is now overstated and should be sold, particularly at the front end of the curve.",0
"Key to our thinking: the fed funds futures market will not experience a 400 basis point surprise in 2023 the way it did in 2022, and bond yields and term premia are now much closer to our targets.",0
"Against this backdrop, hedging against higher interest rates entails a more nuanced tradeoff, in our opinion, while securities with built-in call risk such as MBS should become more appealing.",0
"In terms of risks to our overall outlook, there are four major risks where we are focused: Risk #1: Growth Slows Sharply Towards More of a 2008- Type Downturn.",0
Our forecasts are predicated on growth slowing but not collapsing in a 2008-like fashion.,0
"One can see this in Exhibits 22 and 23 , respectively.",1
"There are three things to consider, we believe.",1
"First, we forecast unemployment increasing by 1.4% point trough to peak today, more akin to the 1.9% increase in 2001 compared to 2008 when unemployment surged 5.1%.",0
"Second, we also do not see the banks needing to de-leverage as much as they did during the GFC.",0
"Most leverage levels are at 10-12x, not 20-30x.",1
"Finally, we do not think that underlying equity in mortgages gets impaired, given better underwriting, tighter supply, and more equity in each deal.",0
"To be sure, we have house prices falling five percent in 2023 ( Exhibit 113) , down from 14% appreciation in 2022, but we do not forecast a major collapse in major economies such as the YOU.S, France and Germany ( Exhibit 14) .",0
"So, if the environment becomes much worse than we anticipate and we experience 2008-like stresses to the system, then our decision to steadily add risk during 2023 could be the wrong one.",0

"If this happens, then the right playbook is to go back to what worked in 2010-2016 (average inflation during this period was just 1.6%).",0

"That forecast is materially higher than the peak of about 80 basis points on a quarterly basis during the last Fed hiking cycle, but lower than the median peak over the last sixty years (which is actually around three percent or more).",0
"Indeed, history would suggest that the Fed may end up delivering more tightening than we currently expect in order to control inflation in 2023, particularly given the fact that wage growth remains high and consumer inflation expectations remain elevated.",0

"Notably, this is the first time we have taken down an inflation forecast since 2021.",0
"We think the back-to-back downside surprises in October and November YOU.S. CPI were indeed significant, as the details showed a convincing pattern of peaking shelter inflation, cooling medical inflation, and falling goods prices, consistent with our longstanding thesis on deflationary goods and inflationary services.",0
"While these developments do not make us want to lower our outlook for fed funds (in fact, we are raising our December 2023 forecast +25 basis points to 4.875%), they do because us to assign less weight to our high case Fed scenarios (See YOU.S. Rates section, below, for more details).",0
"Without question, the road ahead will still be bumpy, with durable goods potentially cooling in a nonlinear manner and government data catching up to the rent growth that is already incorporated into our proprietary leading indicators.",0
"Moreover, we continue to expect CPI to settle at a higher resting rate this cycle, most notably because labor costs and consumer expectations remain inflationary.",0
"However, the good news is that the direction of travel has definitely improved, which gives us more confidence that the YOU.S. will avoid our worst-case scenarios for inflation and Fed tightening this cycle.",0
Key YOU.S. Inflation Takeaways 1 We have higher conviction that goods inflation will be negative on a year-over-year basis in 2023.,0
"That being said, we do not expect goods prices to cool in a linear fashion as some companies have pushed through price increases even as real consumer demand has stagnated.",0
"2 Services inflation appears to be stabilizing, albeit at levels that remain much too high.",0
"Importantly, within Services, shelter inflation is in the process of peaking, we believe.",0
3 Labor costs are the single most inflationary input into our KKR Core CPI indicator.,0
"While we think that overall inflation has likely peaked, the combination of higher incomes and a higher tolerance for inflation raises the risk of periodic re-accelerations in CPI over the course of this cycle.",0
4 Corporate margins will remain under pressure in 2023.,0
The reality of higher labor costs amidst slowing nominal GDP will create a backdrop that further dents margins for businesses.,0
"Bottom line: We now have greater conviction that core inflation has peaked, which diminishes the odds of a worst-case scenario when it comes to peak fed funds.",0
"At the same time, we continue to be guards-up about earnings as wage growth rises above CPI inflation and goods prices turn negative year-over-year.",0
"Said differently, the focus is shifting from how high inflation goes in 2022 to how high inflation stays in 2023 and beyond, meaning that defendable margins are becoming more important as price growth cools heading into next year.",0

"Section II: Key Macro Inputs YOU.S. Rates In our view, Fed policy in 2023 will be defined by how the FOMC balances two competing imperatives: 1) cooling what remains an overheated labor market, versus 2) managing the potential adverse impacts of further tightening on the housing market, which is already showing overt signs of weakness.",0
"On the one hand, the YOU.S. worker shortage is getting worse on a secular basis, in our view, which means that the Fed will likely need to deliver more tightening over the course of this cycle than markets currently expect.",0
"On the other hand, we do not think the housing market can tolerate short-term rates holding above five percent on a sustained basis.",0
"Our base case envisions the Fed threading the needle between these two constraints, with rates rising modestly in the near term, but then staying higher for longer as policymakers seek to contain inflationary impulses in the labor market.",0
"We think this approach would be consistent with Chairman Powells recent comment that policymakers are focused on effecting persistent moves, rather than short-term moves, in financial conditions.",0
"Specifically, we see the Fed hiking rates to the low five per- cent range next year before cutting slightly as inflation and GDP slow heading into year-end.",0
"More precisely, we forecast short rates peaking out at 5.125% in 2Q23 and ending 4Q23 at 4.875%.",0
"Thereafter, our base case envisions the Feds policy rate drifting toward a higher resting neutral level, hit- ting 4.125% at year-end 2024 and 3.375% at year-end 2025 before settling around 3.125% in 2026 and beyond.",0
How do we arrive at these forecasts?,1
Our models suggest that fed funds holding above the low five percent range on a,0
 30 WWW.KKR.COM INSIGHTS: OUTLOOK FOR 2023: KEEP IT SIMPLE sustained basis would push mortgage rates into the mid- seven percent range which is above the seven percent threshold that our proprietary KKR 2022 Homebuyer Survey indicated would lead most active homebuyers to abandon their searches.,0
"Mortgage rates at that level would also put more pressure on housing affordability, which is already at a 40-year low (Exhibit 44) .",0
"In that scenario, we think that homebuyers stepping back from the market would flow through into materially lower home prices and weaker consumer balance sheets, increasing the risk of a more jarring YOU.S. economic downturn.",0
"As such, housing market dynamics imply a 5.125% speed limit for fed funds this cycle, we believe.",0
"On the other hand, we think that the Fed is increasingly concerned about what Chairman Powell called a structural labor shortage putting sustained downward pressure on YOU.S. unemployment, as a demographics-driven slowdown limits the number of young people joining the labor force, while the effects of early retirements during COVID continue to impact the availability of older workers.",0
"Said differently, it seems likely that YOU.S. wage growth has experienced a level-shift higher during the pandemic, which means that the Fed will need to hold rates higher for longer to meet its dual mandate of low unemployment and low inflation, in our view.",0
"That aligns with our analysis in Exhibit 46 , which suggests that the Fed will need to hold rates near five percent through late 2023 in order to bring inflation closer to its two percent target.",0
"If we are right, then the good news is that the fat tails of much higher or much lower rates are narrowing.",0
"However, there are still serious upside risks to consider, particularly for the next 12-18 months.",0
"To capture these risks, we have built a detailed scenario analysis for our deal teams.",1
"One can see this in Exhibit 43 , which shows that we still see a cumulative 35% chance that the Fed raises rates to the high- five percent range next year (i.e., higher than our base case of 5.125%, which we assign 55% weighting).",0
We believe a more aggressive Fed tightening cycle could occur either: 1.,0
Because the relationship between housing markets and interest rates is weaker than we expect and higher rates are required to cool inflation (our High case); or 2.,0
Because the Fed overtightens in the near-term and is then forced to cut as the housing market deteriorates (our Overshoot case).,0
"Both of these risks demand serious consideration, which is why we encourage investors to hedge exposure to higher rates in the near term if possible.",0
"Importantly, though, our framework suggests that upside risks to our base case should diminish over time, particularly as the lagged effects of bal- ance sheet policy begin to play out in the real economy.",0

"This view continues to be an important area of differentiation for us, as the consensus for the 10-year bund is for two percent at end-2023 and end-2024.",0
It is important to note that our forecasts imply 50 basis points of yield curve inversion from the depo rate to the German 10-year.,0
"This forecast reflects our assumption that the long- term neutral rate for the depo rate is 2.25%, and that the ECB will be forced to cut rates to that level starting in 2025.",0
"Given this, the 10-year rate is likely to stay below the depo rate, but we believe only about 50 basis points below, as quantitative tightening will keep upward pressure on rates at the long end of the curve.",0

"QT is particularly challenging in Europe, we believe, because there are 19 bond markets for the central bank to consider.",0
"Some peripheral markets, notably Italy, have inherent weaknesses that may drive rates there above what the ECB desires for monetary policy reasons.",0
Policymakers do have a couple of levers under the QT umbrella and will likely not apply QT to the ECBs entire bond portfolio at once (likely stopping the reinvestment of maturing securities in the Asset Purchase Program representing 60% of the total volume of bonds it holds but continuing to reinvest under the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Program which holds 40% of QE bonds).,0

"Question #2: Do you think we are still in a regime change, given the recent improvement in YOU.S. inflation?",0
"Since the onset of COVID, we have been talking about a different kind of recovery, or a different regime that would require a new approach to asset allocation.",0
Key to our thinking has been that volatile inflation would impede central banks ability to step in and provide ample support during periods of dislocation.,0
"Importantly, in this current cycle, demand-side inflation, which many investors are used to seeing, would actually be super-ceded by supply-driven inflation.",0
We note the following supply-side constraints: 1.,1
"The energy transition is actually inflationary , as it requires many hard to find inputs in volatile parts of the world, while most of the processing of these commodities occurs in China, which provides its own unique set of challenges.",0
"Cobalt, for example, is mined in scale in the Congo, while most of the Manganese in the world comes from South Africa.",1

"The latest employment data confirm these trends, as the participation rate for 25-54 year olds is back near pre-pandemic levels, despite companies still having to pay out materially to retain workers.",0

"As such, the underlying structural inflationary dynamics created by the aforementioned four considerations will continue to constrain the ability of central banks to ease policy quickly.",0
"Consistent with this view, Chairman Powell in late December said that he does not see the Fed loosening policy until inflation is definitely on track to again hit two percent.

Question #3: What indicators help us determine a bottom on overall risk positioning?,0
"As we referenced earlier, we think that history suggests that both Equities after falling 25% and Credit especially when it trades at 85 cents on the dollar or cheaper appear attractive from a valuation perspective.",0
"One can see this in Exhibits 3 and 4 , respectively.",1
"However, we also understand that many investors want specific signposts for when to structurally lean in.",0
"To be sure, there is no absolute certainty around timing; each cycle is different based on monetary policy, growth dynamics, and inflationary trends.",1
"That said, there are some pretty standard indicators that my colleague Brian Leung and the team often watch.",1
"They are as follows: Key Indicator #1: A Bottoming in the ISM As we show in Exhibit 87 , the year-over-year performance in the S&P 500 and the ISM manufacturing index are very tightly linked.",0
"To review, the ISM measures the change in production levels across the YOU.S. economy from month to month, and it is released the first day of the month to indicate the level of demand for products by measuring the amount of ordering activity at the nations factories.",1
"According to Brian, our best estimate is that it will trough this cycle in the low 40s around mid-2023.",0

"To this end, we roughly approximate that the mid- dle of the recession we anticipate could be in the spring or summer of 2023.",0
"Importantly, given that equity markets and bond markets have sold off dramatically in advance of this potential event, we would rather be early than late on adding risk.",0
This viewpoint is consistent with our thesis to not wait until the end of recessions to start to add back risks to ones portfolio ( Exhibit 88 ).,0

"Hence, our decision to walk, not run, in 2022 made sense.",0
"However, as one can see in Exhibit 89 , market bottoms tend to occur when the Fed slows its hawkish campaigns.",0
"Though this cycle may be a little different, given the Federal Reserves sizeable balance sheet, we do not think it changes the message.",0
"As such, given that we have the Fed finishing its tightening campaign at 5.125% in 1H23, with cuts potentially starting by the end of the year, we think investors should be adding risk to their portfolios by mid-2023.",0
"Key Indicator #4: Buy six to nine months ahead of a bottom in earnings estimates Conventional wisdom is that markets bottom when the earnings slate is clean, and as one analyst put it to me, forward earnings actually look achievable.

"So, when we pull all our indicators together to assess this cycle, we feel that earnings and the behavior of the Federal Reserve are probably the signals to overweight.",0
Key to our thinking is that we are transitioning from the markets re-pricing worse than expected inflation towards a period where inflations adverse effects dent corporate profits and consumer balance sheets.,0
"As such, we need to be right that 1) inflation is actually peaking and the Fed has some wiggle room to slow its historic tightening campaign; and 2) this economic downturn is more akin to the shallow recession of 2001 than the harsh economic pullback of 2008.",0

"So, our bottom line is that amidst high inflation, higher interest rates and falling household net worth, the overall consumer picture in 2023 is definitely negative but not disastrous.",0
"However, within the consumer economy, we do expect a notable divergence.",0
"Specifically, while companies with defendable margins should hold up reasonably well this cycle, the corollary is that the hit to consumer spending will disproportionately fall on durable goods companies and services companies with uncontrolled labor costs.",0
Question #7: What are your thoughts on expected returns this cycle?,1
We recently reviewed return assumptions across asset classes in both public and private markets.,1
"See Exhibit 119 below for details, but our main takeaways were as follows: 1.",1
Fixed income returns should be higher than they were last cycle.,0
"Higher projected Investment Grade and High Yield returns reflect, first and foremost, the math of higher coupons in a world where we think bond yields settle in the 3-3.5% range.",0
"While corporate defaults are likely to rise from todays ultra-low levels, the combination of higher nominal GDP growth and companies having termed out their debt during the pandemic should help keep credit losses relatively tame compared to past cycles.",0
"Meanwhile, while we think credit spreads may widen modestly, a sharp move would probably require a drastic slowdown in growth, which would in turn provoke a dovish pivot in Fed policy, too; said differently, we assign a small probability to an outcome in which both spreads widen and risk-free rates stay really high.",0
Large-cap YOU.S. equity returns will likely be lower.,0
One consequence of our call for treasury yields to stay higher this cycle is that P/E ratios have only limited scope to re-rate from todays levels.,0
"If we are right and we think we are then earnings growth, rather than multiple expansion, will drive the bulk of S&P 500 returns over the next five years.",0
"The good news is that even accounting for a near-term EPS downturn, strong overall nominal GDP growth should translate into mid-high single digit returns for large-cap YOU.S. equities.",0
"Though it is lower than what investors are used to from the last five years, that return profile aligns with the fundamental signal from our top-down five-year real returns model, which has a good track record of predicting real equity market returns from simple macro variables (Exhibit 125).",0
"Importantly, we are actually more constructive on both YOU.S. small-cap and certain non-YOU.S. stocks relative to the last cycle.",0
"Top of mind for us is that small-cap multiples have de-rated much more than large-cap multiples (Russell 2000 P/E is roughly two standard deviations below its long-run average, versus S&P 500 P/E near its long-run average), while a peak in Fed hawkishness should be a tailwind for foreign-currency assets.",0
"Outside of the YOU.S., we caution that investors need to pick the right market, particularly given idiosyncratic risks around de-globalization.",0
"Indeed, as mentioned earlier, public",1
" 66 WWW.KKR.COM INSIGHTS: OUTLOOK FOR 2023: KEEP IT SIMPLE markets in countries like like Indonesia are actually overweight large financials, and at the same time, have very little exposure to rising GDP-per-capita stories in their public markets.",0
Real Assets remain an asset class of choice.,1
"No question, the cash flows from Real Assets become more appealing in an environment of higher nominal GDP growth.",0
That thesis has been the backbone of our decision to overweight collateral-based cash flows in recent years.,0
"To be sure, we acknowledge that the performance of Real Estate and Infrastructure returns may slow relative to the last five years, which reflects first and foremost the fact that nominal GDP, while still quite elevated, is slowing.",0
"Nonetheless, we continue to think that Real Assets, especially Infrastructure, Energy, and Real Estate Credit, should be a larger part of investors portfolios in a world where real interest rates even after a historic rate tightening campaign remain relatively low.",0
"They are also an important shock absorber if we are right that stocks and bonds will continue to sell off together (i.e., are now positively correlated) during bouts of rising inflation.",0
The illiquidity premium will become more important amidst heightened volatility.,0
"Even after inflation peaks, we think that the threat of higher inflation will present a new constraint on global monetary policy relative to the last twenty years.",0
"This new reality will limit central banks abilities to smooth fluctuations in markets, and increase volatility across rates, FX, and real GDP growth relative to past cycles.",0
"Against this backdrop, we think that there is more value in the illiquidity premium than there was during the post-GFC era (Exhibit 18), with alpha becoming a more important contribution relative to beta in private market returns.",0
"Exhibit 118 While the Absolute Amount of Dry Powder Has Increased, It Has Not Actually Changed Relative to the Size of the Capital Markets $632 $1,258 $600 $700 $800 $900 $1000 $1100 $1200 $1300 $1400 $1500 0.0% 0.5% 1.0% 1.5% 2.0% 2.5% 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 2021 2022 Global Buyout Dry Powder, % of World Market Cap Global Buyout Dry Powder ($Bn, Right Axis) 2022 dry powder estimated as at 3Q22.",0
"Data as at December 6, 2022.",1
"Source: Pitchbook, Bloomberg.",1
The bottom line for us is that investors will need a different playbook relative to what worked during the last five years.,0
"Within public markets, leaning into large-cap YOU.S. Equities at the expense of everything else may not deliver the same results as it did in the past.",0
"In particular, we see better performance for Credit and for small-cap and non- YOU.S. equities.",0
We also think that a larger illiquidity premium will emerge in private markets.,0
We also see both the return profile of and the diversification provided by Real Assets remaining an important driver of portfolio performance in the coming years.,0
"Perhaps most importantly, we think that investors will need to take a more holistic approach to portfolio construction relative to past cycles, as many of the familiar relationships between asset-level returns have shifted in a world of high inflation and more restrictive interest rate policy.",0

What is your latest view of the 60/40 portfolio?,1
"For some years, we have argued that from an asset allocation and portfolio diversification perspective, quantitative easing likely overstated the importance of bonds as both income producers as well as shock absorbers. In May 2022, Racim Allouani, who heads our Global Portfolio Construction Group at KKR, and Thibaud Monmirel, a colleague on Racims team, began to pound the table harder on this call as quantitative tightening accelerated, changing the underlying characteristics of existing portfolios.",0
"At that time, we published an Insight s note Regime Change: Enhancing the Traditional Portfolio, that made the case that the traditional 60/40 allocation was not providing the same benefits to a balanced portfolio as in the past.",0
"As an alternative, we suggested considering an increase in allocations to more inflation resilient assets such as Private Credit, Infrastructure and Real Estate in a 40/30/30 Equities/Bonds/Alternatives construct.",0
The bottom line for us is that investors will need a different playbook relative to what worked during the last five years.,0
"Within public markets, leaning into large-cap YOU.S. Equities at the expense of everything else may not deliver the same results as it did in the past.",0
"In particular, we see better performance for Credit and for small-cap and non YOU.S. equities.",0
We also think that a larger illiquidity premium will emerge in private markets.,0

30% Traditional Fixed Income plus 10% Private Credit Shifting a portion of the portfolio to floating rate assets helps boost the income-generating component of the fixed income allocation.,0
It also shortens the duration and provides some valuable diversification to the overall portfolio.,0

"Said differently, a tactical rally may be in store, especially if we are right in our forecast that the YOU.S. 10-year yield peaked in 2022.",0
"However, our long-term viewpoint around portfolio construction is unchanged.",0

"As such, we think we are in a different regime for asset allocation.",0
2 We reiterate our view that a 40/30/30 Equities-Bonds-Alternatives allocation offers more robustness around diversification and inflation protection for the macroeconomic environment ahead.,0
"In the follow-up to our May 2022 portfolio construction paper, we examine our suggested 10% allocation to Private Credit.",1
3 We think that the case for Private Credit is actually more compelling today than when we wrote our original piece in May 2022.,0
"This asset class is benefitting from traditional lenders being sidelined, as capital charges mount amidst a large amount of hung loans.",0
"We also see improved lending terms, higher absolute rates, and larger companies.",0
4 While building this 10% Private Credit allocation (which in general takes a few years) we propose investors pay attention to the current value offered in traded credit.,0
"We see some compelling relative value in CLO liabilities for example, which can be used as a bridge to get to the 10% Private Credit allocation.",0
5 Institutional and individual investors may look for different ways to implement our views.,1
"Draw-down funds remain compelling options for institutions and high net worth individuals, but we also see some compelling tactical opportunities across BDCs, interval funds, and even some high quality ETFs.",0
"So, as we look ahead, we think that long-term investors should not rush back into the 60/40 simply based on performance.",0
"Rather, we continue to advocate for some form of a more diversified portfolio, including our 40/30/30 portfolio framework.",0
There are several considerations that we think are worth highlighting to investors.,1
"Most importantly, though, is that we maintain high conviction that the traditional stock-bond correlation will remain challenged over the next 5-7 years.",0
Key to our thinking is that we will have a higher resting heart rate for inflation as well as our belief that larger fiscal deficits will persist in developed economies.,0
"Finally, we see Quantitative Tightening as a headwind to the role bonds played in portfolios during the last decade or so.",0
"These insights are hugely important, as the bedrock of the 60/40 allocation is the negative correlation between stocks and bonds, allowing Bonds to cushion Equity losses when they occur.",0
"As numerous studies have shown and as we have witnessed first-hand this year, higher levels of and uncertainty around inflation play a major role in pushing the stock-bond correlation higher.",0
"And as we outline in Question #2 above, even though we think that inflation will cool in 2023, we believe that the stock-bond correlation will not return to the levels of the past two decades given the structurally inflationary risks that the pandemic has highlighted.",0
"Simply relying on bonds to hedge equity holdings in this new macro regime we envision is a suboptimal stance, in our view.",0
"Instead, we believe that investors will need to use more of the tools at their disposal to increase the robustness of their portfolio diversification in the challenging macroeconomic environment ahead ( Exhibit 124 ).",0

"However, making money in 2023 and beyond will not be easy.",0

"In terms of deployment preferences, our message is straightforward: Keep It Simple.",1
"We have exited TINA (there is no alternative), and as such, one does not need to stretch to make an adequate total return.",0

We retain our bullish bent on collateral-based cash flows .,0
"Infrastructure, Real Estate Credit, and many parts of Asset-Based Finance look extremely attractive to us right now.",0
"We also like what these types of investments do to a portfolio during a higher interest rate, higher inflation, and higher nominal GDP environment.",0
"Most importantly, they provide both income and diversification.",0
In todays market we heavily favor a solution of different Credit products that can provide both above average yield relative to recent history and some convexity if inflation is peaking .,0
"Said differently, we like the high absolute yield and floating rate nature of Private Credit today, but we also like the convexity that Liquid Credit, including High Yield, can potentially provide if rates increases cool.",0
"While overall Equity returns are coming down, we think that there is a significant opportunity in small caps.",0
We also like dividend-growing aristocratic equities that have good capital allocators as CEOs .,0
"Within Private Equity, we believe strongly in companies with simple unit economics and modest leverage.",0
"Cash flow conversion, not big TAMs (total addressable markets) will be the key attribute in this new macroeconomic environment we envision.",0
"Importantly, though, across all these asset classes, our message is to keep it simple , including moving higher up in the capital structure when possible, not over-extending on duration, and focusing on quality.",0
"Consistent with this view, we think the reality that many banks are no longer extending credit as freely means that it is a good time to fill that gap and be a lender to high quality counterparties.",0

" I N V E S T M E N T O YOU T L O O K F O ARE 2 0 2 3 - 5 - Executive summary In our 2023 Investment Outlook, we seek to guide investors at a pivotal moment for the global economy.",0
"We live in an age of transformation, with surging inflation and fundamental geopolitical shifts leading to rising demands on governments.",0
"A sustainable recovery In the terms of the progressing green transformation, we believe that, as investors, we must continue to focus our resources on sustainable long-term growth.",0
"We see opportunities in the shift leading to, for example, green hydrogen, restoring natural capital or building green infrastructure.",0
Investment themes for the long run Our themes have both a sustainable angle energy transition and environmental sustainability and a focus on enduring trends.,0
"These trends include innovation and disruption via new technology, the appeal of private markets and the emergence of China.",0
"While any significant re-rating of China A-shares may be unlikely now, valuations appear attractive and argue for strategic positioning.",0
Opportunities include consumption upgrading and hard-tech development.,0
"Macroeconomics and markets These sections highlight that: The global economy is on the brink of recession as policy rates shoot higher, Europe faces an energy shock, and China struggles with zero-Covid policies and fragile property markets.",0
" The Chinese government has scope to stimulate growth, but in the West, government measures to aid households and companies may undermine central bank inflation-busting.",0
" Equities face a struggle to generate above-average returns, even as the disconnect between still relatively optimistic corporate earnings expectations and economic reality narrows.",0
"We are neutral, with deep caution in Europe offset by optimism for US growth stocks.",0
" Within fixed income, eurozone investment-grade credit offers the most attractive opportunity with wide spreads, but generally good corporate fundamentals.",0
 I N V E S T M E N T O YOU T L O O K F O ARE 2 0 2 3 - 6 - The global economy seems on an inevitable march towards recession.,0
"The causes are well-known: central banks aggressively raising policy rates to reduce inflation, an energy shock in Europe, and zero-Covid policies (ZCP) and a shaky property market in China.",0
Much of Europe is already in recession.,0
"We expect one to begin in the US in the third quarter of 2023, and while Chinas growth will likely not turn negative, it will be below historic levels.",0
"One can easily think of ways in which the situation could yet worsen: a breakdown in a key financial market due to the rapid rise in interest rates, a cold winter and blackouts in Europe, or a flare-up in geopolitical tensions between the US and China.",0
"US Given the strength of the US labour market, reflected not only in a low unemployment rate, but also in high (nominal) wage gains, declines in non-farm payrolls in 2023 will likely be necessary.",0
"Consumer demand will weaken, even though households still have a large amount of excess savings.",0
"These savings are falling and, we should note, are concentrated among high-income/low-consumption households.",0
A deterioration of the labour market will be key to bringing services inflation under control.,0
"Goods inflation should drop thanks to base effects and lower demand, while MACRO OUTLOOK DANIEL MORRIS Chief market strategist The recession march",0
 I N V E S T M E N T O YOU T L O O K F O ARE 2 0 2 3 - 7 - shelter costs will eventually reflect the ongoing slowdown in the housing market.,0
We anticipate core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation will fall below 3% by the end of 2023.,0
One open question is whether wage inflation can be reduced without a large increase in unemployment.,0
"The number of job vacancies relative to the size of the labour force is still about twice the long-run average 1 , meaning companies are forced to raise wages to attract workers (see Exhibit 1).",0
"Historically, vacancies only decline significantly when the unemployment rate rises.",0
The US Federal Reserve believes that the currently high number of vacancies reflects the reorganisation of the labour market and the economy following the pandemic.,0
"As that process ends, vacancies could fall without the unemployment rate necessarily rising.",0
There is another reason to believe the unemployment rate may not rise very much.,0
"US companies have learned from the lockdown recession that firing employees may reduce costs in the short term, but it creates problems later on.",0
"They may move towards a more European model, where employees are kept on the payroll through a recession, allowing for a swifter and smoother recovery later.",0
"Offsetting the drag from higher policy rates will be the ongoing investments triggered by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, and the Inflation Reduction Act, which will direct nearly USD 400 billion in tax credits and subsidies for numerous clean energy programmes.",0

 I N V E S T M E N T O YOU T L O O K F O ARE 2 0 2 3 - 8 - Eurozone Europe is facing an energy shock unlike anything the region has seen since the OPEC price increases in the 1970s (see Exhibit 2).,0
"Even though gas prices have moderated of late, they are still 10 times higher than the average in 2019.",0
"Inflation is in double digits in some countries, consumer sentiment has collapsed, and demand is weakening along with disposable income.",0
"Nonetheless, we believe headline inflation has peaked and will return to the ECBs 2% target in 2024.",0
The response of governments to economic shocks has changed since the pandemic.,0
"Instead of counting on automatic stabilisers such as unemployment insurance to tide households through the downturn, governments have resorted to more direct support to mitigate any decline in income (or corporate profits).",0

"Since then, we have seen a ten-fold increase in sustainable investment related regulations.",0
"Here, we explore this evolution and the path that lies ahead.",0
The great financial crisis raised important questions about the role of finance.,1
"The industry has long interpreted its fiduciary duty to clients as a requirement to maximise financial returns for beneficiaries, most often on a horizon of quarters or years.",0
"Since 2005, the industry has rigorously debated the impact of integrating environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria into this duty.",0
The discussion has been buffeted by parallel debates over the timeframe across which return maximisation should be sought and for which beneficiaries.,0
"In 2005, the research basis for understanding the financial impact of ESG considerations was relatively thin.",1
"Since then, our understanding of this topic has grown massively.",0
The evolution of sustainable finance,0
 I N V E S T M E N T O YOU T L O O K F O ARE 2 0 2 3 - 1 7 - There is much to do to realise ESG integration with proper strength and accuracy across portfolios ESG factors and investment outcomes What we can now say with some certainty is that ESG integration at corporate and fund levels more often than not leads to better financial outcomes.,0
"Thanks largely to the efforts of the PRI and other industry groups, the fiduciary duty debate has largely been put to bed.",0
"Investors controlling more than USD 100 trillion in assets have agreed at the highest levels to this preface to the PRIs six principles: As institutional investors, we have a duty to act in the best long-term interests of our beneficiaries.",1
"In this fiduciary role, we believe that environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) issues can affect the performance of investment portfolios (to varying degrees across companies, sectors, regions, asset classes and through time).",0
"We also recognise that applying these Principles may better align investors with broader objectives of society. While the investment industry agrees in principle, much remains to be done to realise ESG integration with proper strength and accuracy across portfolios.",0
The gap between ambition and actuality underlies much of the recent criticism of ESG (namely greenwashing) revolving around misleading claims by some investors and the messiness of ESG data.,0
Regulators have stepped up their efforts to create clarity on the definition and application of sustainability.,0
Sustainable investment regulations have grown globally from below 50 in 2015 to more than 500.,0
"1 Tackling ESG criticism Here, we explore some of the criticisms.",1
"Often, they go too far and warrant a closer look on the basis of the following: ESG has been an attention grabber, not a distraction.",0
ESG integration efforts have highlighted issues such as climate risk and diversity.,0
This has likely accelerated corporate and policy action rather than distracted from them.,0
"Admittedly, many environmental and social indicators have worsened over the past 20 years.",0
But would the environment and society be better off if the investment industry had ignored ESG as was largely the case before 2004?,0
 ESG is just data.,1
"At the most basic level, ESG indicators convey dispassionate information about company management that can materially impact results.",1
"True, the data is often sparsely disclosed, rarely audited and diversely interpreted.",1

"While this may be the case for some passive funds and their ESG equivalents, the data does not support this claim for the bulk of actively managed ESG funds.",0
"For the most part, ESG funds are priced similarly to equivalent standard funds.",1
 ESG is more than just emissions.,1
"While climate change can be seen as the most important global systemic risk, it is not the only one.",0
"For instance, if we succeed in cutting emissions, but exacerbate inequality, we will be trading one systemic risk for another.",0
"The ability to generate sustainable returns relies on a healthy planet and population Necessary step to sustainable finance Before ESG, there was Socially Responsible Investing.",0
SRI was dedicated to the creation of a just and sustainable economic system.,0
"With the advent of the PRI, the focus shifted to ESG factors.",0
This stripped away notions of responsibility and irresponsibility to focus on the bottom line and the financial risks and rewards of accounting for these factors.,0
The success of the ESG movement has set the table for broader discussions on the future of sustainable finance.,0
"We are coming full circle, moving away from a pure financial focus on integrating ESG factors towards recognising that investors have real impact on the world and that their ability to generate sustainable returns relies on a healthy planet and population.",0
More than 270 asset managers with some USD 61 trillion in assets under management have now committed to net zero portfolio emissions by 2050 by signing the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative.,0
"2 Without the efforts of the PRI and other industry groups, we would not now see ESG issues on the agendas in most boardrooms and policy action being taken to address ESG transparency and encourage investment in sustainability solutions.",0
"We also see that the world has not made the required progress towards a low- carbon, environmentally sustainable and inclusive economy that we collectively require to ensure long-term returns.",0

" I N V E S T M E N T O YOU T L O O K F O ARE 2 0 2 3 - 2 5 - CHINA Deglobalisation in the context of China decoupling CHI LO Senior market strategist APAC Decouple-from-China has been a market issue since the Sino-US trade war started in 2018, with some large developed countries pushing for reshoring their global production.",0
"This has led to concern about deglobalisation, or the breaking- up of supply chains and decelerating cross-border trade and investment.",0
"These developments have shaken the argument for investing in Asia, including China, which lies at the heart of many global supply chains.",0
"Restrictions on technology transfers, among other trade-disrupting measures, are currently the biggest uncertainty for Asia; a third of its exports involve electronic and other tech products.",0
The Covid-19 crisis aggravated the concern over the outlook for manufacturing in Asia disrupting global supply chains and creating shortages of everything from building materials and car parts to semiconductors.,0
"Asias supply chains shifting Though these worries have driven some large companies to cut their sourcing from or manufacturing operations in Asia and to shift them elsewhere, we see no large- scale decoupling from either the region or from China.",0
"Firstly, defying expectations that the trade war and the pandemic would crimp Sino- US bilateral trade, trade actually rose from an annualised USD 620 billion in June 2018 to USD 801 billion in August 2022.",0
This was partly because US shipments to,0
" I N V E S T M E N T O YOU T L O O K F O ARE 2 0 2 3 - 2 6 - China picked up, even though Chinese purchases fell short of the so-called Phase One deal signed in January 2020.",0
"Secondly, rather than reducing their reliance on Asian supply chains, US importers have increased imports from the wider ASEAN region.",0
1 Flows of foreign direct investment (FDI) to China have risen over the last six years (see Exhibit 1).,0
Buying more from ASEAN does not mean buying less or decoupling from China No decoupling Buying more from ASEAN does not mean buying less or decoupling from China.,0
"Rather, this shift in the pattern of imports illustrates a so-called China + 1 strategy, in which companies keep producing in China for the local market while moving some capacity to ASEAN.",0
"Relocation is a means to manage the supply chain disruption due to economic, political and, most recently, Covid-19 considerations.",0
This is reflected in the rising flow of FDI to ASEAN (see Exhibit 2).,0
The persistence of investment in China underscores our long-held Invest in China for China view since the US shifted its China policy from constructive engagement to strategic competition in 2016.,0
"The ASEAN member states include Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao, Malaysia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.",1
"Exhibit 1: Foreign direct investment flows to China have continued - no signs of decoupling (balance of payments data, USD bln, 4 quarter rolling sum) -100 -50 0 50 100 150 200 250 300 350 1999 2001 2004 2006 2009 2012 2014 2017 2019 2022 net FDI gross infows Sources: CEIC, BNP Paribas Asset Management, data as of October.2022",1
" I N V E S T M E N T O YOU T L O O K F O ARE 2 0 2 3 - 2 7 - Crucially, a large share of the FDI flows to ASEAN comes from China, which accounts for 40% of the total now as compared to only 10% a few years ago.",0
This actually strengthens the supply-chain integration between ASEAN and China rather than weakening it.,0
"Components used to be shipped from ASEAN to China, which then sold them to the world markets.",1
That made China the worlds factory.,0
Now the process appears to be reversing: China supplies ASEAN with products that power the regions exports to the world.,0
This shift in the supply-chain integration process has expanded the worlds factory to now include Asia.,0
The persistence of investment in China underscores our long-held Invest in China for China view Implications Asias supply chain shift also reflects Chinas dual circulation policy.,0
Beijing aims to use its internal growth impetus to drive domestic and regional growth.,0
This potential is a strong basis for long-term investment in emerging Asia and China.,0
"From a macroeconomic perspective, this development will likely lead to strong intra-regional economic linkages confounding the deglobalisation trend.",0
"With inflation concerns rising and companies facing higher input price pressures, the cost advantages of sourcing from Asia, whose supply chains have integrated further with China, are becoming more obvious.",0
Subtle shifts are underway to make Asia an emerging production hub for world markets.,0
We see little evidence yet of global and regional decoupling from China.,0
"One can run, but not hide, from the Middle Kingdom.",1

"In this article, we focus on infrastructure debt.",1
"Amid the search for yield and the need for portfolio quality, the private debt segment is becoming increasingly relevant.",0
"Having grown by 13-14% a year over the past decade, total private debt assets under management (AUM) now exceed well over USD 1 trillion.",0
"As an asset class, private debt has been resilient across economic cycles.",0
"As an example, it was the only private markets asset class to have increased fundraising every year since 2011, including during the pandemic.",0
"For investors willing to invest their money for longer periods, private debt can be a good portfolio diversifier, offering low volatility and a low correlation to listed markets.",0
"Other attractions include an appealing relative value, inflation-linked cash flows and an illiquidity premium over listed assets.",0
Floating rate instruments are part of the segment.,1
"They can be more attractive than vanilla bonds as their coupon is linked to a base rate, allowing it to increase amid rising market interest rates.",0
" I N V E S T M E N T O YOU T L O O K F O ARE 2 0 2 3 - 2 9 - Recession-proof essential services Historically, infrastructure debt has shown itself to be a haven.",0
This segment offers a diverse range of exposures across many defensive sectors (see Exhibit 1) and risk- return profiles.,1
"Overall, we believe the segment is well positioned for recession, for the same reasons that it navigated the pandemic better than other asset classes: many infrastructure projects involve essential services that are in demand in times of boom and times of bust.",0
"In other words, when times are tough, people will still need rail networks, energy to heat and light their homes, etc.",0
"Infrastructure debt is well positioned for recession As investments, infrastructure assets from fibre optic networks and car parks to utilities and roads are marked by high barriers to entry: projects cost large sums to complete, keeping competitors at bay.",0
"Often, they involve monopolistic market positions and regulated tariffs.",1
Their long-dated cash flows across economic cycles offer stability to investors.,0
"Green infrastructure Infrastructure debt also has environmental, social, and governance (ESG) aspects.",1
"Many infrastructure assets are at the forefront of the energy transition and digitalisation, partly on the back of the European Union's objectives for decarbonisation and net zero by 2050.",0
"Exhibit 1: Core infrastructure asset financing: European sector breakdown Energy 24% Telecommunication 23% Renewables 21% Transport 16% Power 7% Environment 4% Social 4% Other 1% Source: Infranews & Inframation, January 2022.",1
" I N V E S T M E N T O YOU T L O O K F O ARE 2 0 2 3 - 3 0 - These goals are driving investment decisions: Along with the large sums for phasing out conventional energy in the utilities sector, more renewable energy infrastructure will need to be built over the next few decades, for example, for electrified fleets and the greater use of (green) hydrogen.",0
"As for the role of digitalisation in decarbonisation, data analytics can help improve (energy) efficiency.",0
"In selecting investments, our proprietary ESG framework has been fully integrated in the investment process.",0
"It includes a comprehensive assessment by our Sustainability Centre, while an independent consultant assesses the impact of each investment based on induced and avoided emissions, the net environmental contribution and temperature alignment with the Paris Accord.",1
"Junior infrastructure debt, which delivers higher, equity-like returns, could be an attractive option Junior debt to weather the storm Over the past 10 years, infrastructure debt has offered consistently higher yields than listed bonds, partly due to the additional return investors receive for forgoing the flexibility of publicly traded markets.",0
"While infrastructure debt returns have remained fairly consistent, central bank rate rises have boosted yields on government and corporate bonds, sapping the yield premium.",0
"For investors seeking a yield similar to equivalently rated corporate bonds, this has made the choice between these two asset classes less straightforward.",0
"However, we believe junior infrastructure debt, which delivers higher, equity-like returns while maintaining debt-like protections such as covenants, and contained risk, could be an attractive option.",0
"We see growing opportunities in the telecoms space: glass fibre networks are rolled out in Europe, datacentres and telecom towers are needed for the explosion of data usage and new 5G technology.",0
"Overall, we expect infrastructure debt as a segment to expand further, not least as the need for financing around the energy transition and decarbonisation continues to grow.",0

" Fixed Income MUSINGS FIXED INCOME Goldman Sachs Asset Management 1 July 29, 2022 POLICY PICTURE The Fed appears to have concluded the expeditious phase of its tightening cycle, delivering a 75bps rate hike to take the policy rate to their own neutral estimate of 2.25- 2.5%.",0
"Markets responded favourably in anticipation of a slower pace of tightening ahead (see Chart) given a loss of growth momentum, emerging signs of easing inflation pressures and the Feds emphasis on data dependence going forward (see quote).",0
"Overall, we think the outlook for Fed policy has turned more balanced.",0
"We expect a further rate increase in September, with the hike increment being guided by key data releases such as the employment cost index, PCE inflation and measures of consumer inflation expectations.",0
"Thereafter, we think signs of softening in both the labour market and inflation outturns could see the Fed pause to assess the impact of this years rapid tightening.",0
"After all, the Fed has raised rates by 2.25% in just five months.",0
"Notwithstanding the growing accumulation of evidence on weaker growth prospects for the second half of the year, policymakers appear to be retaining a glass-half-full assessment of the economy.",0
"During the post-meeting press conference Fed Chair Jerome Powell said he does not think the US is currently in recession as there are just too many areas of the economy that are performing too well. Meanwhile, US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen highlighted the creation of almost 400,000 jobs a month is not a recession and that a recession would require a broad- based weakening of the economy which is inconsistent with recent data.",0

" Fixed Income MUSINGS Goldman Sachs Asset Management 2 FIXED INCOME July 29, 2022 MACRO AT A GLANCE Economic data has turned more mixed and is not consistently supportive of rapid monetary tightening.",0
"For example, flash composite PMI readings for July were in contractionary territory in the US and Euro Area (see Chart).",0
Weakness on the services side of the economy likely reflects the cost-of-living crisis and indicates the post- Omicron rebound is behind us.,0
"In Europe, high inflation continues to weigh on sentiment with the German ifo Business Climate index falling to its lowest level since June 2020.",0
"Meanwhile, the US economy experienced its second consecutive quarter of negative GDP growth.",0
"With nonfarm payroll growth averaging 375,000 during the second quarter and GDP data subject to revisions, we do not think the economy was in a recession in the first half of the year, however, we acknowledge risks are building.",0
NAVIGATING FIXED INCOME A bad news is good news dynamic has emerged whereby signs of slowing growth and easing inflation pressures provides some relief for markets due to reduced risks of policy overtightening.,0
"That said, within fixed income sectors, bouts of weakness in lower-quality bonds reflects growing growth concerns (see Chart).",0
We used recent strength in high yield corporate credit as an opening to scale back our exposure.,0
"Overall, we remain overweight corporate bonds given continued strength in corporate balance sheet positions.",0

 Bullish on JPY in medium term-(1) BoJ already has a good portion of Japans wage settlement data and Japans CPI now seems to be experiencing greater pass-through of costs by businesses; (2) Japans terms of trade have structurally bottomed; (3) Relative balance sheet comparison shows BoJ balance sheet has contracted at a faster pace than the Fed; (4) Fed closes to peak rates.,0

This leaves the 0.6550 0.6600 area very well supported in AUDUSD.,0

"Important Disclosure on High Yield Bonds Unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities typically offer a higher yield than investment grade Debt Securities, but also present greater risks with respect to liquidity, volatility, and non-payment of principal and interest.",0
"As a result of being classified as non investment grade Debt Securities, these Debt Securities present a greater degree of credit risk relative to many other fixed income Debt Securities.",0
Higher Credit Risk Unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities generally have predominantly speculative characteristics with respect to the issuers capacity to pay interest and repay principal.,1
There is greater risk of non-payment of interest and loss of principal.,1
"Many issuers of these Debt Securities have experienced substantial difficulties in servicing their debt obligations, which has led to default and restructurings.",0
The issuers of these Debt Securities generally have to pay a higher rate of interest than investment grade Debt Securities.,1
Higher Liquidity and Secondary Market Risk The markets in which unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities are traded are generally more limited than those in which investment grade Debt Securities are traded.,1
This lack of liquidity may make it more difficult to resell these Debt Securities and obtain market quotations.,0
Downgrade Risk Downgrades in the credit rating of unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities by rating agencies are generally accompanied by declines in the market value of these Debt Securities.,1
"In some circumstances, investors in the unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities market may anticipate such downgrades as a result of these credits being placed on credit watch by rating agencies, causing volatility and speculation of further credit deterioration.",0
"Higher Vulnerability to economic cycles - During economic downturns, unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities are typically more susceptible to price volatility and fall more in value than investment grade Debt Securities as i) investors may reevaluate holdings in lower-quality bonds in favor of investment-grade corporate Debt Securities; ii) investors become more risk averse; and iii) default risk rises.",0
This is often referred to a flight to quality.,0
"Event Risk This includes any of a variety of events that can adversely affect the issuer of unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities, and therefore the issuers ability to meet debt service obligations to repay principal and interest to Debt Securities holders.",1
"Event risk may pertain to the issuer specifically, the industry or business sector of the issuer, or generally upon the overall economy.",1
It could have a direct or indirect impact on the issuer and their outstanding debts.,1
"Important Disclosure on RMB Risk relating to RMB If you choose RMB as the base currency or the alternate currency, you should also note the following: RMB is currently not freely convertible through banks in Hong Kong.",1
"Due to exchange controls and/or restrictions imposed on the convertibility, utilization or transferability of RMB (if any) which in turn is affected by, amongst other things, the PRC government's control, there is no guarantee that disruption in the transferability, convertibility or liquidity of RMB will not occur.",1
There is thus a likelihood that you may not be able to convert RMB received into other freely convertible currencies.,0
"CNH exchange rates and CNY exchange rates are currently quoted in different markets with different exchange rates, whereby their exchange rate movements may not be in the same direction or magnitude.",1

 INTRODUCTION Out of the depths Most things that could have gone wrong for investors did in 2022.,0
"Markets that entered the year with extended valuations buckled in the face of elevated inflation, an aggressive global rate hiking cycle, war in Ukraine and economic challenges in China.",0
"Unusually, both stocks and bonds suffered big losses in 2022one of the worst years ever for a balanced portfolio.",0
" INTRODUCTION As we move into 2023, investors still have many difficult questions to consider.",0
How much further could interest rates rise?,0
When will inflation come back to earth?,0
"Is a recession inevitable, and how bad could it get?",0
" INTRODUCTION In this years outlook, we evaluate the fallout from a historic global tightening cyclehigher interest rates will rein in inflation, but recessions are likely in the United States and Europeand we assess the degree to which market pricing already reflects a future downturn.",0
"Even as economic growth deteriorates, we think markets could stabilize in 2023.",0
"Higher bond yields offer total return potential, and they could provide portfolios with valuable ballast during a downturn.",0
"Equity markets may remain challenged by weaker earnings growth, but stock prices now incorporate a substantial degree of future damage.",0
"Precisely because markets are so battered, lower equity valuations and higher bond yields, in our view, mean that investors now enjoy the most attractive entry point for a traditional portfolio in over a decade.",0
"Already, market dislocations have appeared that investors can take advantage of.",0
Those with capital to invest can find the potential for compelling returns across asset classes and risk levels.,0
"As you design and revise your goals-based plan, that is welcome news indeed.",0
 WEAKER GROWTH The consequences of global tightening Policy rate hikes are having their intended impacts.,0
" WEAKER GROWTH As of late 2022, 26 of the 31 central banks that we track were raising rates, up from just two at the start of 2021.",0
The Federal Reserve (Fed) engaged in its most aggressive round of interest rate hikes in 40 years.,0
"The European Central Bank (ECB) has been no less forceful, recently raising its policy rate by 0.75% to levels last seen before the global financial crisis (GFC).",0
And the ECB seems set to keep raising rates despite the clear threats to growth.,0
"After a little over a decade of low or negative policy rates, the campaign against inflation caused a historic rout in bond markets.",0
"The Barclays Global Aggregate Index is on track to lose over 10% in 2022, its worst year on record.",0
Negative yielding debt (a pervasive feature of the post-GFC landscape) has disappeared everywhere except Japan.,0

"Both the job openings rate and the quits rate have declined, albeit to elevated levels.",0
Average hourly earnings seem to have hit their high-water mark and are now rising at a ~4.5% pace.,0
Corporate earnings reports also suggest moderating labor demand and cost pressure.,0
These data points signal that the Fed is getting its desired effect of lower demand for workers.,0
"But success is far from assured, and turning points in the labor market are difficult to identify in real time.",0
"As demand erodes and corporate profit margins deteriorate, more companies will likely freeze hiring or lay off workers to cut costs.",0
"Many companies that were darlings of the social- distancing era (e.g., Amazon, Peloton and Meta) have done so already.",0
We expect the unemployment rate to rise in 2023 as higher rates broadly slow the economy.,0

"Given the signals from private measures, we are looking for softer rental inflation readings by the middle of next year.",0
"Globally, we think inflation will continue its downward trajectory throughout 2023, reaching levels consistent with most central bank targets by 2024.",0
"Weaker growth, softer labor markets and falling inflation will likely lead to the end of the global rate hiking cycle in 2023.",0

" WEAKER GROWTH Latin America: A (relative) bright spot For nearly two years, Latin America has outperformed other emerging and developed markets both in terms of growth and market performance.",0
"Despite the aggressive Fed tightening cycle, major currencies in the region strengthened in 2022.",0
"The Brazilian real and Mexican peso rose 9% and 5.5%, respectively.",0
Latin American central banks were among the first to start hiking rates in 2021.,0
"By the end of 2022, most were able to pause, and it is possible they could start lowering rates by the middle of 2023.",0
"This would provide an important tailwind for Latin Americas equity markets, which are trading at some of their lowest valuations over the last 15 years.",0
" OPTIONAL EYEBROW TITLE WEAKER GROWTH If monetary policy does ease, we do not think exchange rates will suffer.",0
That is because real rates (especially in Brazil) are among the highest in the world.,0
Latin America will not escape the effects of a weakening global economy.,0
But it should be relatively sheltered by its significant exposure to the commodities sector.,0
Politics pose the main risk to Latin Americas economies.,0

That is a change that all investors should pay attention to.,1
Current yields in many parts of the fixed income complex are now equivalent to historical equity returns.,0

" STRONGER MARKETS In fact, market pricing suggests that short-term interest rates will remain above 3.1% for the better part of the next decade.",0
"We believe that outcome is unlikely, and think investors should lock in elevated yields now.",0
"Moving beyond core fixed income, potential returns and risks are greater when we consider less creditworthy issuers or securities that are subordinate in the capital structure.",0
"As we assess the asset class, the high yield bond market is pricing in a deceleration in economic growth and deterioration in credit quality, but not yet an outright recession.",0
"Even so, its all-in yield of nearly 10% offers an attractive alternative to equity exposure even after accounting for potential losses from default.",0
"Meanwhile, preferred equities could be interesting for some investors.",0
They display characteristics of both fixed income (prices are determined in part by interest rates) and equities (they react to changing perceptions about corporate earnings).,1
Both rising rates and concerns about economic growth sparked a ~20% drawdown in these securities so far this year.,0
We like the entry point for preferred equities.,0
"Unlike high yield bonds, default risk is more limited, given that investment grade companies are the most common issuers.",0
"What is more, prices could rebound if yields decline.",0
YOU.S. taxpayers also benefit from the qualified dividend income tax treatment of the coupons.,0
 STRONGER MARKETS No one knows precisely when stock markets will bottom.,1
But a ~20% decline in stocks is relatively rare and has historically presented the best entry points for investors with medium- to long-term time horizons.,0
This cycle should be no different.,1
"In 2023, we believe equities are well positioned to deliver positive returns.",0
Any material decline from current levels could represent a good buying opportunity.,0
"Turning first to the YOU.S. market, analysts do seem a little too optimistic in projecting earnings growth of nearly 7.5% for the S&P 500 in 2023.",0
We are penciling in flat-to-negative earnings growth in light of a weakening economic backdrop.,0
But earnings expectations are just one part of the equation.,1
"In the United States, as inflation subsides, the tightening cycle nears its end and rates hit their ceiling, we expect equity valuations to expand.",0
Together those two factors should deliver modest positive returns for the S&P 500 next year.,0
"Clearly, taming inflation is a prerequisite for stock market gains.",0
We could see some rotation in market sectors.,0
"Investors may move back into interest ratesensitive sectors (such as real estate and reasonably priced technology) as bond yields peak, and exit cyclical sectors that could be at risk if markets price in greater risk of recession.",0
The picture is mixed across regions.,0
"Although current valuations in Europe and China seem attractive, we think YOU.S. dollarbased investors should wait for a clearer turn lower in the dollar and a turn higher in the global manufacturing cycle before boosting their non-YOU.S. equity exposures.",0
"We may get the chance, as the YOU.S. dollar looks very stretched relative to historical valuations.",0
We believe equities will deliver positive total returns in 2023.,0
 STRONGER MARKETS Emerging markets outside of China could offer some interesting trading opportunities.,0
"Brazilian equities seem attractive on a valuation basis, and we like South Koreas exposure to the semiconductor industry.",0
"Over the longer term, structural trends such as food scarcity and reliance on oil (despite progress toward the clean energy transition) will likely offset idiosyncratic risks in regions such as the Middle East and Latin America.",0
"As the cycle progresses, we may find an opportunity to add to most emerging markets in 2023.",0
"On a regional basis, we prefer YOU.S. stocks, which tend to be more insulated from global downturns.",0
"On a sector level, we prefer healthcare.",1
"Revenues are not as cyclical as they are in other sectors, and valuations seem reasonable.",0
"We also see opportunity in quality, cash flowgenerating tech and tech-related companies that were hit by higher interest rates.",0
Industrial companies provide some inflation protection and benefit from the tailwind of global infrastructure and defense investment.,0
"Dividend growth and value companies could be well positioned, given the uncertain macro environment and higher interest rates.",0
A trend that we think will continue into 2023: Under- performance of the mega-cap tech leaders of the last cycle relative to the broad market.,0
We also think investors should now consider small- and mid-cap companies.,0
"Generally, smaller companies tend to grow faster than large caps, benefit from merger and acquisition activity, and could be somewhat insulated from a more stringent regulatory environment.",0
Valuations have fallen to recessionary levels and may already reflect a material decline in earnings.,0
"During recessions, small- and mid-cap companies only underperform large-cap stocks by ~5%, and they outperform large-cap stocks by 30% in the first year of the recovery.",0
We think the time to add is now.,1
"As the year progresses, we will be on the lookout for other dislocated pockets of the market.",0

 STRONGER MARKETS Once-booming private markets have started to feel the strain that is all but inescapable in public markets.,0
"Growth equity funds, real estate vehicles and private credit managers have all experienced varying degrees of markdowns on their assets, and more seem likely.",0
"On the other hand, other alternative investments such as hedge funds that focus on rates, currencies and cross-asset correlations had a banner year and proved their worth as portfolio diversifiers.",0
"In 2023, gold may serve a similar purpose as the dollar and real interest rates find their peaks.",0
"More immediately, the drought of public capital market activity in 2022 means that private market investors can earn a premium for providing both debt and equity financing.",0
"Companies that were planning on an initial public offering in 2022 or 2023 are holding back, given the valuation reset.",0
"Instead, many of these firms are turning to private investors for bridge capital, and private lenders can now demand higher interest rates from potential borrowers.",0
"Similarly, secondary private equity offerings, which have historically demonstrated higher net IRRs (internal rates of return) with more limited manager dispersion than other types of private equity investments, could provide an opportunity to acquire discounted assets from owners who are willing to accept a markdown in exchange for immediate liquidity.",0
"Supply in this area has increased because some institutional investors need to sell illiquid assets to maintain their proper allocations, given the sell-off in both stocks and bonds this year.",0
" STRONGER MARKETS Going forward, we may also see distressed opportunities in real estate and credit as the growth backdrop deteriorates.",0
"As we move into 2023 and beyond, we think there will be a renewed focus on stability and security across the global economy.",0
"The pandemic and shifting geopolitical risks have raised acute issues in areas such as supply chain resilience, access to energy, food and other natural resources, and traditional and digital security.",0
"Real assets such as infrastructure, transportation and the energy transition create a wide range of possibilities for both public and private investors.",0
"Many sectors, such as residential real estate (YOU.S. housing stock has been underbuilt by ~1.5 million homes), shipping (there are only 111 active large shipyards today versus 320 in 2008), and natural resources (large-cap energy capex is down 60% since 2015) have seen a decade of underinvestment that curtails capacity.",0
"The investment shortfall presents opportunity for both yield and total return, though cyclical risks should be taken into account.",0
" STRONGER MARKETS Europe will likely need to redesign its energy infrastructure and supply chain, which should benefit not only natural gas producers and transporters, but also accelerate the green energy transition.",0
Nuclear energy may even start to become a more acceptable option.,0
"Across the global economy, critical infrastructure will continue to provide investors with steady income streams under a wide variety of macroeconomic conditions.",0
"All in all, we rely on private investments to add diversification benefits to portfolios, to target market inefficiencies in opportunistic areas, and to drive attractive returns relative to public benchmarks.",0
Our outlook for 2023 makes those qualities even more valuable.,0
Europe Will likely need to redesign its energy infrastructure and supply chain.,0
Real Assets Many sectors within real assets have seen a decade of underinvestment.,0
 CONCLUSION 2022 tested the resolve of many investors.,0
Equity markets experienced one of their worst drawdowns on record.,0
"Bonds not only failed to protect portfolios from the equity sell-off, but they suffered their steepest losses in decades.",0
But better days lie ahead.,0
We believe markets could stabilize even as the economy worsens in 2023.,0
The global reset in valuations is presenting investors with a broader range of viable options to help achieve their goals.,0

"In our forecast, growth remains at roughly this pace in 2023.",0
"Unlike a year ago, when our forecast for both 2022 and 2023 was below consensus because we expected a negative impact of monetary and especially fiscal tightening, our current 2023 forecast is well above consensus (Exhibit 2).",0
Our disagreement with the consensus is even more visible when we focus on recession probabilities.,0

One immediate reason is that the incoming activity data are nowhere close to recessionary.,0
"The advance GDP report showed 2.6% (annualized) growth in Q3, nonfarm payrolls grew 261k in October, and there were 225k initial jobless claims in the week of November 5.",0
"More fundamentally, there are strong reasons to expect positive growth in coming quarters.",0
"To be sure, the tightening in financial conditions is weighing heavily on growth, to the tune of nearly 2pp at present.",0
But real disposable personal income is rebounding from the plunge seen in H1when fiscal tightening and sharply higher inflation took their tollto a pace of 3%+over the next year (Exhibit 4).,0
"And while there are risks on both sides, we think the real income upturn is likely to be the stronger force as we move through 2023, especially because the financial conditions drag will likely diminish assuming Fed officials do not deliver dramatically more tightening than the rates market is currently pricing.",0
16 November 2022 4 Goldman Sachs Global Economics Analyst,1
 But the most fundamental question is this: how can the Fed bring down inflation by 2 percentage points over the next year with only a pp increase in the unemployment rate (Exhibit 5)?,0
Does not this fly in the face of the experience from prior high-inflation episodesmost notably the 1970sthat ended with a much bigger increase in unemployment?,0
Our answer is that this cycle is different from prior high-inflation periods.,0
The first reason why this cycle is different is that post-pandemic labor market overheating showed up not in excessive employment but in unprecedented job openings.,0
"As shown in Exhibit 6, job openings surged in 2020-2021 as employers sought to keep up with the strongest economic recovery on record amidst continuing Covid fears and exceptionally generous unemployment benefits.",0
"However, employment as a share of the labor force only rose to roughly the pre-pandemic level, not above.",0

 (And employment relative to the working-age population remains below the pre-pandemic level.),0

"Demand has slowed, the pandemic has subsided, unemployment benefits have normalized, and excess savings are coming down.",0
It is therefore not surprising that job openings and our jobs-workers gaptotal labor demand minus total labor supplyare coming down quickly.,0
"Based on timely job openings measures from Linkup and Indeed, we estimate that the jobs-workers gap has declined from a peak of nearly 6 million to just over 4 million, nearly half of the way to the 2mn level required to slow wage growth to a rate compatible with the inflation target (Exhibit 7, left panel).",0
"Partly because of the reduction in the jobs-workers gap, timely measures of nominal wage growth, i.e.",0
"composition-adjusted average hourly earnings and our monthly wage survey composite, have slowed to levels consistent with 4% wage growth (Exhibit 7, right panel).",0
16 November 2022 6 Goldman Sachs Global Economics Analyst,1
" The second reason why this cycle is different is that the recent normalization in supply chains and rental housing markets is a source of disinflation not seen in previous high-inflation episodes such as the 1970s, and it is only beginning to show up in the official numbers (Exhibit 8).",0
"On the goods side, the ongoing rotation from goods to services spending, healing supply chains, and rebounding inventory levels should put downward pressure on core goods prices.",0
"On the services side, asking rents on new leases have decelerated sharply after the one-time jump in rents related to the work from home-related increase in demand for space.",0
The October CPI report suggests that the lagging measure of sequential monthly official CPI shelter inflationwhich captures both new and continuing leaseshas likely peaked too.,0
"Although year-on-year shelter inflation will likely rise through next spring as rents on continuing leases catch up to higher market rates, it is set to slow thereafter.",0

Values before the introduction of the more recent surveys are backcasted statistically.,1
"Source: Haver Analytics, Linkup, Indeed, Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research 16 November 2022 7 Goldman Sachs Global Economics Analyst",1
" The third reason is that long-term inflation expectations remain well-anchored, especially relative to the 1970s.",0
"This is true for each of the available measures, namely those based on 1) surveys of households, 2) surveys of economic forecasters, and 3) inflation-protected bonds.",1
"Measures of short-term inflation expectations remain relatively high, but much of this probably reflects the spike in commodity prices and should wane if commodity prices level off.",0
The fact that inflation has only been high for a short and unusual pandemic period also suggests that elevated inflation is not entrenched (Exhibit 9).,0
"Taken together, we expect year-over-year core PCE inflation to decline from 5.1% in September to 2.9% in December 2023 (Exhibit 10).",0
"We expect supply-constrained durable goods with still elevated margins, such as used cars, to drive nearly half of the slowdown in overall core inflation.",0

 One might assume that our relatively optimistic inflation forecast translates into a relatively dovish Fed call.,0
But that assumption would be wrong.,0
The reason comes back to the interplay between real income and financial conditions.,0
"As real income recovers, a negative FCI growth impulse is required to keep growth below potential and continue rebalancing the labor market.",0
"However, the negative FCI impulse on sequential growth will likely diminish from its current drag of around 2pp annualized because it depends on the change in, rather than the level of, financial conditions (Exhibit 4, right panel).",0
"As a result, and even under our relatively optimistic inflation forecast, additional rate hikes of at least as much as markets are now pricing are likely required to keep the labor market adjustment going.",0
"Following the FCI easing over the past month, we now expect an additional 125bp of Fed rate hikes (vs. 100bp previously) with a downshift in the hiking pace to 50bp in December, and three smaller 25bp hikes in February, March, and now also May.",0

"In our no-recession forecast, the Fed only implements a first gentle 25bp cut in 2024Q2.",0
This baseline of high rates for longer would again illustrate how different this cycle is as the first Fed cut in the median hiking cycle has historically come roughly six months after the last hike.,0

" A Mild Recession in Europe In contrast to the US, the Euro area and the UK are probably in recession.",0
"The reason for this is the much bigger and more drawn-out increase in household energy bills, which should boost headline inflation to peaks of 12% in the Euro area and 11% in the UK, far higher than in the US (Exhibit 12, left panel).",0
"In turn, high inflation is set to weigh on real income, consumption, and industrial production.",0
"We forecast further declines in real income of 1% in the Euro area through 2023Q1 and 3% in the UK through 2023Q2, before a pickup in H2 (Exhibit 12, right panel).",0
The plunge in timely and forward-looking surveys of gas-intensive European industries such as chemicals and metals also suggests that rising energy costs will lower production (Exhibit 13).,0
"As a result, we look for cumulative declines in real GDP of 0.7% in the Euro area (2022Q4-2023Q2) and 1.7% in the UK (2022Q3-2023Q2).",0
"Exhibit 12: A Bigger Energy Shock in Europe Implies a Worse Outlook for Inflation and Real Income Source: Haver Analytics, Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research 16 November 2022 11 Goldman Sachs Global Economics Analyst",0
" Exhibit 13: Surveys of Gas-Intensive European Industries Have Plunged Source: Haver Analytics, Eurostat, Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research However, we do not expect a deep European downturn, barring a very cold winter that imposes more severe energy rationing on the industrial sector in order to keep people warm in their homes.",0
"Already, Europe has cut Russian gas imports by 80% and total gas consumption by 20-25% without crushing aggregate activity.",0
"In fact, most of the hard economic data (as opposed to the surveys) continue to hold up remarkably well so far, with industrial production moving sideways, real GDP still up in the Euro area in Q3 (though down slightly in the UK), and labor markets holding up so far.",0
We think the reason for this resilience is that household energy savings and substitution to other energy sources have helped absorb the collapse in Russian gas imports.,0
"Along with mild weather, these savings have boosted gas storage, reduced TTF gas prices by 60% from their peak, and reduced downside risk from a very cold winter.",0
"Moreover, Europe is likely to benefit from three similar post-pandemic sources of resilience that are helping the US avoid recession altogether.",0
"First, Exhibit 14 shows that the rise in German production of chip-intensive items and carswhere pandemic bottlenecks are still easinghas approximately offset the ongoing decline in energy-intensive production.",0
16 November 2022 12 Goldman Sachs Global Economics Analyst,1
" Second, any decline in the household saving rate would support consumer spending, as happened in the US when real income plunged in early 2022.",0
Exhibit 15 points to room in Europe for saving rates to fall and for consumer credit growth to pick up (although likely by less than in the US because European lower-income households have relatively limited excess savings).,0
"Third, while the bulk of reopening gains are behind us, Europe is still benefiting somewhat from a rebound in the service sector.",0
"While near-term risks of a deep recession have receded somewhat and our commodity strategists now look for a more limited rise in European gas prices next summer, we do not expect GDP to rebound sharply in Europe once it exits a mild recession.",0

"Moreover, fiscal policy turns should turn into a drag from the second half of 2023 onwards.",0
"Incorporating both the resilience in incoming hard data and our less elevated path for gas prices, we have nudged up our Euro area 2023 growth forecast to -0.1% (from -0.4% previously).",0
What about European core inflation?,0
"Although commodities drove the initial headline surge, price pressures have broadened significantly across core categories in both the Euro area and the UK following upside inflation surprises (Exhibit 16, left panel).",0
"In fact, UK core price pressures are now the broadest across the G10, with a perfect storm of an energy crisis (like continental Europe) and an overheated labor market (like the US).",0
"Given this strong momentum, we expect Euro area core inflation to edge up further to a peak of 5.3% year-over-year in December, before gradually declining to just above 3% by end-2023 on goods disinflation.",0
"In the UK, we think that core inflation is peaking right around now and will also decline to 3% by end-2023.",0
"Given reduced risks of deep recession and persistent inflationary pressures, we now expect the ECB to hike through May with an additional 150bp of rate hikes to a peak deposit rate of 3% (vs. 2.75% previously).",0
"Along with the reduction in near-term headline inflation pressures from gas prices, the emphasis on substantial rate hikes so far increases our conviction that the ECB will step down the pace to 50bp in December, in parallel with the Fed.",0
"We maintain our forecast for a second 50bp hike in February but, given the firmer demand outlook, now look for two additional smaller 25bp hikes at the March and May meetings.",0
"The risks around our peak 3% ECB rate are two-sided, with upside risk from potentially more persistent core inflation and downside risk from a deeper recession or a possible flare-up in sovereign risk in Italy.",0
"Given the tight labor market, high wage pressures, and firm inflation, we expect the BoE to hike Bank Rate by an additional 150bp to a terminal rate of 4.5%.",0

 Chinas Bumpy Reopening Our 2023 China outlook is a story of two halves with slow growth in the first half followed by a more pronounced rebound in the second half as the economy reopens (Exhibit 17).,0
We expect weak growth in Q4 and Q1 as the Zero Covid Policy (ZCP) likely stays in place during the winter.,0
"In fact, the recent sharp rise in cases led us to have a significantly below-consensus Q4 estimate of 1.2% annualized.",0
"Exhibit 17: Weak Growth Through H1; Rebound in H2 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 Q4 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 2022 2023 GS Bloomberg Consensus Percent change, quarterly annual rate Percent change, quarterly annual rate China Real GDP Source: Bloomberg, Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research Although the leadership has clearly signaled that it aims to exit ZCP, we do not expect actual reopening to start until April.",0
The basic reason for this is that medical and communication preparations will take time.,1
"Less than 70% of the 60+ age group in Mainland China are triple-vaccinated (Exhibit 18), and data from Hong Kong show that the unvaccinated elderly remain at serious risk of severe outcomes.",0
"As a result, China will need to significantly ramp up its vaccination pace from the current 100k/day before reopening can safely begin.",0
16 November 2022 15 Goldman Sachs Global Economics Analyst,1
" Despite our April reopening baseline, we forecast Q2 growth of just 2% annualized on our assumption that reopening initially triggers an increase in infections that keeps caution high.",0
"Weak growth in East Asian economies such as South Korea, Taiwan, and Hong Kong during the first quarter of exiting ZCP also supports our soft Q2 forecast.",0
"In contrast, we look for a meaningful reopening growth boost in H2, which will likely extend into 2024.",0
"As ZCP is currently still subtracting about 4-5% from the level of GDP, we see substantial room for a cyclical rebound as immunity levels rise and most households learn to live with the virus.",0
"Although clearly above consensus, our Q3 and Q4 forecasts of 10% and 6% annualized are not spectacular relative to other international reopening experiences.",0
"This is because we expect a continued drag from Covid caution as well as other headwinds, some cyclical and some more structural.",0
"On the cyclical side, fiscal policy is set to tighten if the domestic economy rebounds, and Chinas pandemic-related export boom should fade as global demand for tech, housing, and Covid-related products slows further.",0
"On the structural side, we see the contraction of the property sector and US chip export restrictions as multi-year drags.",0
We estimate that the ongoing slide of the property sector will subtract around -1pp from growth next year as it continues to delever and face demographic headwinds (Exhibit 19).,0

" We recently also estimated that the new US restrictions on exports of advanced chips (and the equipment and software to produce them) to China will subtract about pp from China growth next year and 1.7% from the 2026 level of GDP, assuming US policymakers are serious about implementation.",0
"This reflects reduced production in China of both chips and goods using advanced chips, such as smartphones and computers.",0
The relatively muted rebound in aggregate demandcoupled with the relatively limited rise in inflation during reopening in other Asian economiesalso drives our benign forecast for 2023 inflation and monetary policy.,0
"Specifically, we expect core CPI to pick up only slightly from 0.7% to 1.2% next year, and the policy rate to stay flat at just 2%.",0
"Although we do see a sharper reopening boost in 2023H2 and 2024H1 than other forecasters, our long-run China views remain structurally below consensus (Exhibit 20).",0
We estimate that much of the slowdown in actual China growth in recent years corresponds to a slowdown in potential growth to only 4.2% in 2023.,0

 Pockets of Resilience in THEM Early Hikers A number of economies in Latin America as well as Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) started hiking rates well before everyone else.,0
"Among the nine THEM early hikers, the policy rate has increased by an average of over 800bp (Exhibit 21, left panel) while our GS Financial Conditions Index (FCI) has tightened by an average of 450bp.",0
1 Where are these economies headed and what can we learn from their experience for the broader global outlook?,0
"While no early hiker has clearly achieved a soft landing yet, activity has generally held up better than expected.",0
"A majority of early hikers are probably still expanding, based on GDP growth, PMIs, and labor market indicators.",0
"In particular, unemployment rates remain low in all economies, although they have edged up in several economies (Exhibit 21, right panel).",0
"2 We have found that elevated job openings, reopening, and strong private sector balance sheetsagain unique characteristics of this different cyclehelp explain this resilience.",0
"Encouragingly, sequential core inflation and wage growth have begun to moderate across most early hikers, although they remain very high.",0
"The moderation in core inflation is most notable in Brazil, where we expect rate cuts to start in 2023Q2 and growth to pick up back to a potential-like pace of 2% in the second half of the year (Exhibit 22, left panel).",0
"In contrast, the CEE economies are in a more difficult position.",0
"This reflects CEEs exposure to the surge in European gas prices, as well as continued high, broad, and in the cases of Hungary and Poland still-rising inflation.",0
"We therefore expect the Czech and Polish central banks to resume their rate hike campaigns before long (Exhibit 22, 1 We define an early hiker as a country under our coverage that began to increase the policy rate by October 2021 with a cumulative increase in the first six months of at least 100bp.",0
"2 Our classification suggests that Chile is likely in a mild recession, while the Czech Republic and Poland are close calls.",0

" right panel), and look for moderate declines in GDP in most CEE economies.",0
"Overall, the resilience of activity in several THEM early hikers so far supports our view that the current high-inflation period does not need to end in deep recession.",0
"Some Progress, But Still an Uncertain World The key economic question for 2023 is whether central banks will be able to bring down inflation to more acceptable levels without a recession, or at least without a deep recession.",0
"We are reasonably optimistic, but there are substantial risks to our view.",0
One risk is that inflation pressures simply remain pervasive enough that central banks have no choice but to keep tightening aggressively.,0
"If so, a recession might become unavoidable, not just in Europe but also in the US.",0
"The recent news flow has reduced this risk slightly in the US, as the labor market continues to adjust and inflation has begun to slow.",0
But the picture is not uniform.,1
Central banks in Europe and those THEM economies where inflation is still increasing may be forced into further tightening in an environment of exchange rate depreciation and rising inflation expectations.,0
"The other main risk is that underlying inflation does come down, but central banks are late in recognizing the improvement because they are too focused on lagging indicators of inflation such as CPI shelter inflation.",0
"In the US, we have recently become a little less concerned about this risk as well.",0
"Fed officials have made it clear that they are not exclusively focused on the CPI rent numbers but also on more leading indicators such as asking rents on new leases, which have slowed sharply in recent months.",0
"Moreover, many central banks have either already slowed their hiking pace or signaled that they will do so soon.",0
This reduces the risk of overtightening as it will allow for more time to assess the impact of higher rates on the economy.,0
"Beyond the core inflation dynamic, we remain concerned about political and geopolitical Exhibit 22: Inflation and Policy Rates Are Set to Rise Further in CEE While We Expect Rate Cuts in Brazil from 2023Q2 Onwards Note: Regional aggregates use market FX country weights.",0

"Source: Haver Analytics, Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research 16 November 2022 20 Goldman Sachs Global Economics Analyst",1
" shocks, which could affect the global economy via higher uncertainty, tighter financial conditions, or negative effects on commodity supply.",0
Some of these risks have diminished slightly as well.,0
"The Italian, Brazilian, and US midterm elections have come and gone without major market disruptions.",0
"Spreads on Italian government debt have diminished, Brazil may be headed toward a soft landing, and there is even a possibility that the US debt limitarguably the biggest potential source of market disruption emanating from DC in 2023will be resolved in the lame-duck session of Congress between now and year-end 2022.",0
"Moreover, the latest meeting between Presidents Biden and Xi promises to defuse at least some of the tensions between the US and China, which might also help to achieve a negotiated solution to the Russia-Ukraine war.",0
But there are still plenty of risks that could return us to the exceptionally volatile environment of the first half of 2022.,0
"So far, a settlement in the Russia-Ukraine war does not seem close at hand, and the impact of the price cap on Russian oil is uncertain.",0
The political instability in the Middle Eastwhile far from a new feature of the geopolitical orderalso has the potential to deal another blow to energy markets at a time when the supply-demand balance is already precarious.,0
"Thus, our cautiously optimistic global economic outlook remains fraught with substantial risks.",0

" FX Snapshot NZD Citi views & strategy Bias/ Forecasts/ Key levels Citi FX outlook NZD outperformance earlier due to its higher carry looks unsustainable as (1) current highly restrictive NZ financial conditions sharply raise the prospect of a hard landing for the NZ economy; (2) the recent larger 50bp hike sharply reduces odds of further RBNZ tightening; and (3) a strengthening Chinese recovery better supports other currencies closely linked to China (EUR, AUD, SGD, CNH).",0
"Against USD however, the combination of a stronger Chinese recovery in H223 and Fed pivoting towards rate cuts may yet lift NZDUSD in H223.",0

Citi analysts base case is for shortening of the target duration from 10y to 5y or 3y in June meeting (after final outcome of spring wage negotiations).,0

"Important Disclosure on High Yield Bonds Unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities typically offer a higher yield than investment grade Debt Securities, but also present greater risks with respect to liquidity, volatility, and non-payment of principal and interest.",0
"As a result of being classified as non investment grade Debt Securities, these Debt Securities present a greater degree of credit risk relative to many other fixed income Debt Securities.",0
Higher Credit Risk Unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities generally have predominantly speculative characteristics with respect to the issuers capacity to pay interest and repay principal.,1
There is greater risk of non-payment of interest and loss of principal.,1
"Many issuers of these Debt Securities have experienced substantial difficulties in servicing their debt obligations, which has led to default and restructurings.",0
The issuers of these Debt Securities generally have to pay a higher rate of interest than investment grade Debt Securities.,1
Higher Liquidity and Secondary Market Risk The markets in which unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities are traded are generally more limited than those in which investment grade Debt Securities are traded.,1
This lack of liquidity may make it more difficult to resell these Debt Securities and obtain market quotations.,0
Downgrade Risk Downgrades in the credit rating of unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities by rating agencies are generally accompanied by declines in the market value of these Debt Securities.,1
"In some circumstances, investors in the unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities market may anticipate such downgrades as a result of these credits being placed on credit watch by rating agencies, causing volatility and speculation of further credit deterioration.",0
"Higher Vulnerability to economic cycles - During economic downturns, unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities are typically more susceptible to price volatility and fall more in value than investment grade Debt Securities as i) investors may reevaluate holdings in lower-quality bonds in favor of investment-grade corporate Debt Securities; ii) investors become more risk averse; and iii) default risk rises.",0
This is often referred to a flight to quality.,0
"Event Risk This includes any of a variety of events that can adversely affect the issuer of unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities, and therefore the issuers ability to meet debt service obligations to repay principal and interest to Debt Securities holders.",1
"Event risk may pertain to the issuer specifically, the industry or business sector of the issuer, or generally upon the overall economy.",1
It could have a direct or indirect impact on the issuer and their outstanding debts.,1
"Important Disclosure on RMB Risk relating to RMB If you choose RMB as the base currency or the alternate currency, you should also note the following: RMB is currently not freely convertible through banks in Hong Kong.",1
"Due to exchange controls and/or restrictions imposed on the convertibility, utilization or transferability of RMB (if any) which in turn is affected by, amongst other things, the PRC government's control, there is no guarantee that disruption in the transferability, convertibility or liquidity of RMB will not occur.",1
There is thus a likelihood that you may not be able to convert RMB received into other freely convertible currencies.,0
"CNH exchange rates and CNY exchange rates are currently quoted in different markets with different exchange rates, whereby their exchange rate movements may not be in the same direction or magnitude.",1
"Therefore, the CNH exchange rate may be different from the CNY exchange rate.",1

" 1 Outlook Investment Strategy Group 2023 OUTLOOK Dear Clients, To say 2022 was a tumultuous year is an understatement.",0
"Equity markets, which had peaked in January, dropped precipitously in less than two months as investors reacted to higher inflation and Russias invasion of Ukraine.",0
Inflation in turn triggered the tightening of monetary policy.,0
"Central bank policy rates and interest rates across maturities rose at the fastest pace in decades, driving bond prices down by unprecedented amounts.",0
Oil and natural gas prices gyrated as the Nord Stream 2 project was halted and other energy export sanctions were imposed on Russia.,0
"Financial markets were further roiled by growing global geopolitical tensions following the invasion of Ukraine but also aggressive posturing by China, including toward Taiwan.",0
This year is likely to be less tumultuous for markets.,0
Inflation is already trending lower.,0
"Central banks are expected to continue to tighten, but not to the extent seen in 2022.",0
"As a result, bonds will come under less pressure.",0
Oil and natural gas prices are less likely to gyrate.,0
"Still, we face great uncertainty.",0
The US Federal Reserve may overtighten monetary policy and create a recession in the United States.,0
A recession in the worlds largest economy would reverberate globally.,0
The US Congress may repeat the mistakes of 2011 in failing to raise the debt limit in a timely and orderly manner.,0
"Chinas disorderly abandonment of its zero-COVID policy may unleash another wave of COVID-19 infections, including new variants, globally.",0
"The geopolitical outlook for 2023, too, is foggy and fraught with risk.",0
There is no face-saving off-ramp for Russia from Ukraine.,0
China is unlikely to reverse its assertive and aggressive posture.,0
"North Korea is expected to continue, even step up, its ballistic missile tests.",0
"Iran may proceed to enrich its uranium to weapons- grade levels, which could elicit a military response by Israel.",0
We proceed with caution.,1
We start with a careful review of the turmoil in financial markets last year because this backdrop is important in understanding the fog of uncertainty still facing investors.,0
" 2 Goldman Sachs january 2023 Among financial assets, none were spared in 2022.",0
"US equities, as measured by the S&P 500, had a maximum drawdown of 25% and ended the year with a total return of -18% (in line with the bad case scenario, to which we had assigned a 15% probability in last years Outlook ).",0
"The basket of FANGMANT stocks (Facebook/Meta, Apple, Netflix, Google/Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, Nvidia and Tesla), with a maximum aggregate drawdown of 44%, were among the worst-performing stocks in the S&P 500.",0
"Facebook/Meta and Tesla did particularly poorly, experiencing maximum drawdowns of over 70%.",0
"Outside the US, Russian equities had the largest drop, at 51%; China came next, at 45%; they were followed by Italy at 28% and Germany at 26%all in local currency terms.",0
"Also in 2022, bonds, which typically hedge portfolios against equity drawdowns by rising in value, nose-dived in response to a steady stream of rising inflation and interest rate hikes in the advanced economies.",0
The maximum drawdown in the price of 10-year US Treasuries was 22%.,0
It seldom happens that 10-year Treasurieswhich have half the volatility of US equitiesdrop nearly as much as these equities.,0
"The maximum drawdown of 10-year German bunds was 21%, and that of 10-year UK gilts, 26%.",1
"This drop in the price of 10-year UK gilts stood in sharp contrast to the 5% total return of UK equities, as measured by the FTSE 100.",0
The latters positive return was driven primarily by the energy sector and the metals and mining sector.,0
"Shorter-term bond benchmarks declined less but declined nonetheless: the maximum drop was 11% for 1- to 10- year US Treasuries, 12% for 1- to 10-year German bunds and 15% for UK gilts.",0
"Oil and natural gas were thrown into turmoil with the invasion of Ukraine, and energy security has been thrust back into the forefront after a long hiatus.",0
"West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil prices rose 62% between January and June 2022, only to fall 42% to their subsequent trough in early December; for the year, WTI rose 7%.",0
"Similarly, Brent oil prices rose 59%, then fell 38%, ending the year up 10%.",0
"Natural gas prices were even more volatile, with the biggest moves seen in Europe, where prices shot up nearly fivefold by August before",0
 3 Outlook Investment Strategy Group descending as storage facilities filled up given a milder start to the winter season.,0
"For the year, prices were up 8%.",0
"Prices in Europe are still over five times as high as those in the US, where natural gas prices were also volatile last year but much less so than in Europe.",0
"US natural gas prices increased by a cumulative 160% to peak in August before dropping, and now stand 20% above their levels at the start of 2022.",0
"Global economic growth surprised to the downside; our forecast of 4.5% growth for 2022 made at the beginning of the year is now 3.0%, or 30% lower.",0
"US economic growth, forecast last year to be 3.9%, is now estimated to be 50% lower, at 2.0%.",0
The US Consumer Price Index (CPI) reached a peak of 9.1% in June 2022.,0
"Core CPI, which excludes food and energy prices, peaked at 6.6% in September 2022.",0
"The US Federal Reserves preferred measure, the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index, peaked at 7.0%, also in June, and the core PCE price index peaked at 5.4% in February.",0
"Eurozone and UK inflation rates likely peaked in October at 10.6% and 11.1%, respectively.",0
"We expect US inflation to decline to 3.7%, as measured by headline CPI, by the end of 2023.",0
"In 2022, central banks raised rates at one of the fastest paces on record to combat inflation.",0
"As shown in Exhibit 1, such a pace has not been seen in the US since the early 1980s, when the country faced inflation that peaked at nearly 14.8% in March 1980.",0
The pace has also never been seen in the history of the European Central Bank since its inception in 1998.,0
Such a large and rapid increase in policy rates contributed to the turmoil in financial markets; we do not expect a repeat in 2023.,0

 4 Goldman Sachs january 2023 Clients portfolios experienced more volatility in 2022 than usual because equities and bonds declined at the same time in most markets.,0
"It is very rare to have equities and bonds drop over the same period in the US; since 1926, i.e., across 96 years of data, a decline in both equities and bonds over a rolling 12-month window has occurred only 5% of the time when using a 10-year benchmark for bonds, and only 2% of the time when using a 1- to 10-year benchmark.",0
"60/40 Stock/Bond Model Portfolios Notwithstanding such rarity, reports issued last year by several financial institutions challenged the 60/40 stock/bond model portfolios.",0
"Some recommended adding real assets such as commodities, infrastructure and real Exhibit 2: Pillars of the Investment Strategy Groups Investment Philosophy Asset allocation process is client-tailored and independent of implementation vehicles Investment Strategy Group Analytical Rigor History Is a Useful Guide Appropriate Diversification Value Orientation Appropriate Horizon Consistency",1
 5 Outlook Investment Strategy Group estate.,1
Others recommended diversifying portfolios by allocating more assets to Asia ex-Japan.,0
"Still others recommended adding trading strategies, including hedge funds and momentum- and volatility-based strategies.",0
The proliferation of such recommendations prompted some of our clients to ask whether they should reevaluate their strategic asset allocation accordingly.,0
Our response is twofold.,0
"First, appropriate, customized diversification for both institutional and private wealth clients has been a key pillar of the Investment Strategy Groups (ISGs) investment philosophy since its inception more than 20 years ago in 2001 (see Exhibit 2).",0
"Such diversification around a core holding of equities and bonds already includes asset classes and investment strategies that enhance risk/return to preserve and then maximize risk-adjusted wealth, especially at times of heightened uncertainty.",0
"Second, nearly a hundred years of data demonstrates that a mixture of stocks and bonds is an effective starting point for a portfolio, consistent with another pillar of ISGs investment philosophy that history is a useful guide.",0
The 60/40 portfolio has generated positive returns on a rolling 12-month basis 80% of the time since 1926.,0
"Geopolitical Tumult On the geopolitical front, the warning of the late Ash Carter, former US secretary of defense, was realized.",0
"We regularly consulted with him on geopolitical issues, and as was outlined in our 2022 Outlook: Piloting Through , he had asserted that the Russian threat to Ukraine was the most dangerous, dire, and imminent of all the geopolitical risks. 1 So far, the Russia-Ukraine war has led to: About 100,000 casualties on each side, according to General Mark Milley, chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff 2 The exodus of 7.8 million Ukrainian refugees to other countries, particularly in Europe, and another 6.5 million displaced from their homes within Ukraine 3",0
" 6 Goldman Sachs january 2023 Over $100 billion in global military, financial and humanitarian aid to Ukraine (about half from the US), with at least another $45 billion expected in 2023 4 A World Bank estimate of $525 billion$630 billion of reconstruction in Ukraine as of December 5 The war has also led to further deterioration in US-China relations, especially when coupled with the joint China-Russia statement on February 4, 2022, that the friendship between the two States has no limits. 6 The US and its allies have been changing their national security strategies toward China and imposing import and export controls on a wide variety of products.",0
"Turmoil in financial markets coupled with heightened geopolitical risks has raised the risks, though not the certainty, of a recession.",0
"Historically, rapid and extensive tightening by the Federal Reserve has led to recession in the US.",0
Many economists expect it.,0
"Bill Dudley, who served as president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, vice chair of the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee (FOMC) and Goldman Sachs partner, assigns a 70% probability to a US recession in 2023one of the highest probability forecasts in the industry.",0
"At the other extreme, Jan Hatzius, currently Goldman Sachs chief economist and head of Global Investment Research, assigns a 35% probability to a US recessionone of the lowest in the industry.",0
"Incidentally, Dudley and Hatzius developed the Goldman Sachs Financial Conditions Index while they worked together at Goldman Sachs.",1
"The index measures the impact of Federal Reserve policy on the economy through the impact on the financial markets, specifically on short- and intermediate-maturity interest rates, equity markets, incremental yield of corporate bonds and the value of the trade-weighted dollar relative to other currencies.",0
The wide difference between the forecasts of these two former colleagues is mirrored across the economic forecasting community.,0
"Notably, in his latest press conference, on December 14, 2022, Jerome H. Powell, chair of the Federal Reserve, said I do not think anyone knows whether we are going to have a recession or not It is just not knowable. 7",0
" 7 Outlook Investment Strategy Group Similarly, a week later, Lawrence H. Summers, Harvard University professor and former US Treasury secretary, wrote that there is no basis for confident economic prediction.",0
"Some of the most stridently made arguments are also the silliest. 8 When Chair Powell says that it is just not knowable, we take heed; we assign a range of 4555% to the probability of a US recession in 2023.",0
"To provide context: over the last decade, the highest probability we assigned to a recession was 30%.",0
"That was in our 2012 Outlook , after the European sovereign debt crisis; the next-highest probability was 2025%, in our 2020 Outlook .",0
"Today, many leading indicators are pointing in opposite directions, and we believe it is important to convey this uncertainty to our clients unequivocally.",0
"In this uncertain environment, we believe portfolios should not be positioned for the certainty of recession nor for the certainty of modest economic growth.",0
"Instead, we recommend portfolios be positioned at their customized strategic asset allocation, where they are designed to ride out volatility and provide staying power in the event of geopolitical disruptions.",0
"If a recession is averted, financial market returns in 2023 will be less volatile than in 2022; we expect a moderate-risk diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds to provide a total return of 9.0% for taxable clients and 9.8% for tax-exempt clients.",0
"If a recession occurs early in the year, corporate earnings and equities will declinepossibly beyond the maximum drawdown of 2022but bonds will hedge the portfolio by increasing in value, because the starting point of interest rates is much higher than it was at the beginning of 2022.",0
"However, by the end of 2023, as the recession recedes and the fog of uncertainty lifts, the equity market will most likely rally.",0
We would expect high-single-digit returns for a moderate-risk diversified portfolio.,0
"If the recession lasts beyond year-end, the equity market will most likely end the year near the lows we saw in 2022, providing a total return of negative 4.4% from year-end 2022 and resulting in a low- to mid-single-digit negative return for a moderate-risk portfolio.",0
"Facing the fog of uncertainty in financial markets, economic growth and geopolitics, we will on our side:",0
" 8 Goldman Sachs january 2023 Watch diligently for hazards and, if appropriate, pull into a safe location and wait for the fog to clear.",1
 Use our fog lights to search for tactical strategies that can take advantage of market volatility as opportunities present themselves.,0
"On our clients side, we recommend that you: Avoid unnecessary lane changes; stay invested at your customized strategic asset allocation.",0
" Allow extra time to reach your destination, as US equity markets will resume their historical upward trajectory.",0
"In Section I, we provide the rationale for assigning a 4555% probability to the risk of a US recession in 2023.",0
"We compare this tightening cycle to past tightening cycles and explain that although a recession is possible, it is not inevitable.",0
We explain why staying invested in such an uncertain environment is our recommended course of action.,0
"In a March 2009 Sunday Night Insight titled Near-Term Pain, Long-Term Gain , we quoted the highly respected investor Seth Klarman of Baupost, who wrote: To maintain a truly long-term view, investors must be willing to experience significant short-term losses; without the possibility of near-term pain, there can be no long-term gain.",0
"The ability to remain an investor (and not become a day-trader or a bystander) confers an almost unprecedented advantage in this environment. 9 Next, we spell out our one- and five-year expected returns and review our opportunistic tactical tilts coming into 2023.",0
We currently have the lowest level of risk allocated to tactical tilts of the last decade.,0
"We conclude Section I with the key risks to our outlook beyond the recession risks, primarily focused on geopolitical flare-ups and possible new COVID-19 waves originating from China.",0
" 9 Outlook Investment Strategy Group In Section II, we provide a detailed review of our economic outlook for key developed and emerging market countries.",1
Section III details our financial market outlook for these countries.,1
"We present our annual Outlook and our investment recommendations with a strong dose of humility, notwithstanding the considerable research that underpins these reports, including consultation with leading experts.",0
"As always, these and other insights and recommendations are based on rigorous analysis of a wealth of data which we share with our clients.",1
"We also take this opportunity to wish you a healthy, happy, prosperous and calm 2023.",0

 12 Goldman Sachs january 2023 Assessing the Risk of a US Recession we have assigned a probability range of 4555% to the risk of a US recession in 2023.,0
A midpoint of 50% and a 10-percentage-point range reflect the uncertainty of our forecast.,0
"A recession is not our base case, and our investment recommendations are based on this 4555% probability.",0
"Since we at ISG started publishing recession probabilities, we have been quite unequivocal about our forecasts.",0
As shown in SECTION I,1
" 13 Outlook Investment Strategy Group Exhibit 3, our probabilities have ranged from a low of 10% to a high of 30%.",0
Our recession probability for 2022 was 10%.,0
"Since the global financial crisis (GFC), we have never forecast a recession, and except for the brief pandemic-induced recession, the US economy has not experienced one since then.",0
"When we have felt more uncertainty about our probabilities, we have used a five-percentage-point range, as we did in our 2019 and 2020 Outlook reports.",0
"A midpoint of 50% and a 10-percentage- point range, therefore, is unusual for us.",0
"We have evaluated all our recession forecasting models, sought the input of best-in-class economists, and concluded that the tools and analyses that favor a recession in 2023 are as convincing as those that do not.",0
We also have a wider probability range than usual because it has given us flexibility to adjust to incoming data.,0
"For example, favorable economic data such as declining inflation or declining job openings prompts us to lean toward the low end of our range, while less favorable data that points to an overheated economy and more aggressive Federal Reserve tightening prompts us to lean toward the high end of the range.",0
"Despite finding ourselves in this difficult position, we are reassured by two observations.",0
"First and foremost are Chair Powells comments, noted earlier, indicating that it is just not knowable at this point whether we will have a recession or not.",0
"He also mentioned that FOMC decisions will depend on the totality of incoming data and decisions will be made meeting by meeting.10 As the FOMC members react to incoming data, their responses will increase or decrease the risks of recession.",0
"Second is Canadian-American economist John Kenneth Galbraiths comment, One of the greatest pieces of economic wisdom is to know what you do not know. We have also incorporated additional noneconomic risks into our recession forecast.",0
"They include a new wave of COVID-19 spreading around the world as a result of Chinas reopening, heightened geopolitical risks emanating from Russia and debt ceiling negotiations in the US sometime in the second half of 2023.",0
"While each of these risks individually may not throw a well- balanced economy into recession, two or more in conjunction with continued Federal Reserve tightening of monetary policy are likely to do so.",0
We review those risks later in this report.,1
Key Arguments in Favor of a US Recession The most compelling and most frequently cited rationale for predicting a recession in 2023 is the speed of tightening conducted by the Federal Reserve and the subsequent tightening of financial conditions.,0
"As the Federal Reserve tightens monetary policy by raising the federal funds rate and reducing the size of its balance sheet, financial conditions are tightened as: Interest rates rise across the Treasury yield curve.",0
 The incremental cost of borrowing across businesses and households increases.,0
" Equity markets decline, creating a negative wealth effect in which consumers reduce consumption as they become less wealthy.",0
"Exhibit 3: ISG US Recession Probabilities Since 2012 Prior to 2023, our recession probabilities for the US have ranged from 10% to 30%.",0

Source: Investment Strategy Group.,1
* The ISG Outlook reports in 2015 and 2016 included descriptive assessments of recession probabilities (few signs of recession (2015) and low probability (2016)).,0
One of the greatest pieces of economic wisdom is to know what you do not know.,1
 John Kenneth Galbraith,1
" 14 Goldman Sachs january 2023 The dollar appreciates relative to other currencies, lowering exports as the cost of US goods rises for non-US-dollar importers.",0
"As we discussed in last years Outlook report, Piloting Through , not every Federal Reserve hiking cycle and subsequent tightening of financial conditions has resulted in a recession.",0
"Of 15 hiking cycles in the post-WWII period, only nine, or 60% of the cycles, did so.",0
The cycles that led to recessions can be differentiated from those that did not by some combination of the magnitude of tightening and the pace of tightening.,1
"As shown in Exhibit 4, the magnitude of policy tightening over the past 10 months has been the greatest and the pace has been the fastest on record since the stagflation of the 1970s and early 1980s.",0
That period was marked by a ninefold increase in the price of oil from about $4 per barrel before the Arab oil embargo to about $40 per barrel after the Iranian Revolution and Iran-Iraq War.,0
"CPI reached 14.8% in March 1980, and core CPI reached 13.6% in June of the same year.11 In the current cycle, CPI peaked at 9.1%; core CPI peaked at 6.6%.",0
The tightening of financial conditions was equally severe in 2022.,0
"As shown in Exhibit 5, from its trough in November 2021, the Goldman Sachs US Financial Conditions Index increased by more than four percentage points.",0
This was the biggest tightening in 11 months since the GFC.,0
"It was driven by the rapid increase in interest rates, the increase in the incremental yield (also known as the spread) in corporate bonds, the drop in equity prices and the large appreciation of the dollar.",0
The best example of the impact of tighter financial conditions is the change in residential mortgage rates.,0
"Mortgages rates increased from 3.11% at the beginning of the year to a peak of 7.08% in late October, reflecting the combined impact of an increase in Treasury interest rates and an increase in spreads.",0
Such high mortgage rates lowered homeownership affordability to levels below those of the GFC (see Exhibit 6).,0
"A decline in home prices, as measured by the Case-Shiller national home price index, followed, as shown in Exhibit 7.",0
"As we noted earlier, history is a useful guide.",1
"It shows that since WWII, such significant tightening in a short time has always led to a recession.",0
"History, however, is less helpful in telling us when a recession might unfold.",0
"The number of months from when a hiking cycle has begun to when a recession has begun has ranged from 11 to 43, with an average of 30 months and a median of 31.",0
The tightening in this cycle started in March 2022.,0
"Taking the historical experience at face value, that start date implies a recession could start as early as the first quarter of 2023 or as late as the fourth quarter of 2025.",0
With such a wide range of potential recession start dates and the fact that the historical average and median Exhibit 4: 10-Month Change in the Federal Funds Rate The fast pace of Federal Reserve rate hikes in 2022 has not been seen since the early 1980s.,0

 15 Outlook Investment Strategy Group would imply a recession does not begin until sometime later in 2024we recommend clients stay invested.,0
"As we will discuss later in this section, our one- and five-year expected returns result in attractive portfolio returns.",0
It is also not prudent to stay on the sidelines by being invested in cash for 30 months or longer and risk forgoing those attractive portfolio returns.,0
"A model developed by Eric Engstrom and Steven Sharpe, two economists at the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, referred to as the Engstrom-Sharpe model, supports the view that a recession is likely but not imminent.",0
"The model looks at the spread between the interest rate on a 3-month Treasury bill in 18 months as priced by the Treasury market, and the current interest rate for a 3-month Treasury bill.",1
That model assigns a 70% probability to a recession unfolding in 12 months so a recession is likely in 2024.,0
The model assigned a 1% probability in early 2022.,0
Our ISG models also suggest a recession is likely.,0
"Our most reliablebut not foolproof model is the ISG Yield Curve Inversion Diffusion Index, which looks at four yield curves over daily, weekly and monthly frequencies.",0
"When the index has reached 100%, meaning all the yield curve inversions have been triggered, a recession has followed all nine times except in 1965 (see Exhibit 8).",0
"This index triggered a recession signal when it reached 100% on July 25, 2022.",0
"Although this index has a reliable 89% hit ratio (percentage of time it has been successful), the time to recession after the index was triggered has been bimodal.",0
"As shown in Exhibit 9, the recession has typically started either about seven months or 1.5 to two years after the trigger date.",0
"The likelihood of a recession within seven months of the trigger date, in this case by February 2023, is low.",0

Hence, we examine other factors that, in our judgment, point to a lower likelihood of recession than that shown by the models.",0

" 17 Outlook Investment Strategy Group Key Arguments Against a US Recession We now consider four factors suggesting the US economy may be able to avoid a recession: a balanced economy, a shorter lag of policy tightening, declining inflation and the possibility of fewer Federal Reserve hikes than are currently expected.",0
Balanced Economy The US economy is even more balanced today than it was at the end of 2021.,0
A more balanced economy is likely to absorb shocks much better than an imbalanced economy.,0
Exhibit 11 is a Financial Excess Monitor produced by our colleagues on the Goldman Sachs US Economics Research team.,1
"We have been using this tool since David Mericle, chief Goldman Sachs US economist, and the US Economics Research team created it in March 2018.",1
"It comprises 46 different measures, such as the housing-price- to-rent ratio, commercial real estate price index, credit card interest rates relative to the risk- free rate, incremental yield of corporate bonds, equity market valuations, personal savings rate, corporate debt-to-GDP growth rate, leverage in the financial sector, and federal and state government debt.",1
The monitor highlights pockets of risks in the US economy and financial markets.,0
Red signifies excesses; blue signifies a well-balanced sector or metric.,0
"The monitor shows that all sectors improved in 2022 except for households/ consumers and housing, which showed a slight deterioration.",0
"In aggregate, the US economy is more balanced today than it was a year ago: the total line is a light shade of blue rather than white.",0
"Importantly, both the financial sector and the non-financial business sector improvedcaptured by the darker shades of blue.",0
Some observers have expressed concern about the increase in debt levels in the non-financial corporate sector.,0
"As shown in Exhibit 12, non-financial corporate debt as a share of GDP stands at 49.7%, the highest it is been since 1980 except for the pandemic-related spike.",0
"While this level may appear alarming, it does not seem Exhibit 11: Global Investment Research Financial Excess Monitor The types of imbalances that preceded the dot-com bubble and GFC are notably absent today.",0

Most of the increase was driven by high-quality investment grade bond issuers that issued debt in order to take advantage of the low level of interest rates.,0
"The average coupon level of investment grade corporate debt is 3.7%, which is close to the lowest level since 1973.",0
"The median level of the interest coverage ratio (the ratio of earnings before interest and tax payments to interest expense) for investment grade borrowers is at 7.0x, which is the highest since 1999.",0
"As shown in Exhibit 13, the cost of servicing the debt as a share of income is the lowest since 1980, at 10.3%.",0
"Because most of the debt is fixed- rate and generally of longer maturity, an increase in interest rates does not have a material impact on the cost of servicing the debt.",1
"An increase of two percentage points in interest rates raises the cost of servicing the debt to 14.7%, still very low by historical standards.",0
"We should note that while the level of imbalance in the households/consumer sector has deteriorated relative to the end of 2021, households still have significant excess savings, estimated at over $1.5 trillion.",0
"According to Bank of America data, households have savings and checking account balances that are still above pre-pandemic levels across all income cohorts, including lower-income and younger households.",0
"13 Shorter Lag of Policy Tightening According to a Financial Conditions Index growth impulse model developed by Mericle and his team, the drag on GDP growth from tightening of financial conditions occurs sooner than is typically thought by most market participants.",0

" With respect to shelter inflation, which is about 40% of core CPI, both the Case-Shiller national home price index and the alternative measures of rent inflation have been declining, as shown in Exhibits 7 (referenced earlier) and 17.",0
"Due to the mechanics of how housing inflation is calculated, the current decline impacts official shelter inflation with a lag of as long as a year.",0
"Since policymakers are aware of this mechanical delay, they are likely to incorporate these contemporaneous measures of shelter inflation into their decision- making process.",0
 Wages have been the most persistent source of inflation in 2022.,0
"However, we expect wage pressures to abate slowly as the number of job openings declines, the unemployment rate increases and lower headline inflation reduces the bargaining power for wage negotiations.",0

We now turn to our analysis of 60/40 portfolios.,1
We show why a stock/bond portfolio is still a compelling starting point and how diversifying the portfolio by adding certain asset classes and strategies provides the optimal strategic asset allocation.,0
"60/40 Stock/Bond Portfolios Following the negative returns of both stocks and bonds in 2022, several institutions have questioned the viability of 60/40 stock/bond portfolios.",0
We should note that the term 60/40 stock/ bond portfolio is used generically by the financial industry to mean a portfolio of stocks and bonds; it does not imply that a 60/40 mix is the right allocation for every client.,1
The Financial Times reports that private capital titans insist that the traditional 60/40 investor allocation between listed stocks and bonds has been rendered useless by central bank largesse correlating the entire market. 15 Some asset management firms have suggested rethinking traditional stock/bond portfolios or having a makeover. Quite a few firms warn of a lost decade for 60/40 portfolios.,0
Most recommend adding asset classes such as commodities and hedge funds to hedge against the positive correlation between stocks and bonds seen in 2022.,0
Others have recommended adding factor-based investment strategies and active equity managers to improve performance.,0
This range of suggestions has prompted some clients to ask us whether they should change their strategic asset allocation.,0
"We do recommend clients reevaluate their strategic asset allocation on a regular basis, especially after a tumultuous year, to make sure that their portfolios are tailored to their risk tolerance, tax status and preferences.",0
"However, clients should not alter their strategic asset allocation simply in response to the noise around 60/40 portfolios.",0
"Our reasoning is twofold: What transpired in 2022 in terms of negative returns for both bonds and stocks is a rare occurrence, and clients should not adjust portfolios solely because of a rare occurrence.",0
"We also find that positive correlations between stocks and bonds are common, and such correlations alone do not invalidate the value of 60/40 portfolios.",0
There is no need to change asset allocation because of market performance in 2022.,0
 ISGs strategic asset allocation process uses a mix of stock/bond portfolios (60/40 or other mixes of stocks and bonds) as a launching pad.,1
The 60/40 portfolio merely provides a reference benchmark: many asset classes are added to a clients portfolio to improve the risk/return profile relative to a portfolio of only stocks and bonds.,0
"Of course, while we refer Exhibit 22: Percentage of Time Recession Occured by End of Period The cumulative probability of a recession from 1981 to 2022 has been 12% in one year and 24% in two years.",0

"Frequency of Negative Returns in Stocks and Bonds Negative returns in both stocks and bonds over any 12-month window have occurred only 2% of the time since 1926, as shown in Exhibit 23.",0
We used the S&P 500 Index to represent stocks and the Bloomberg Barclays US intermediate 1- to 10-year Treasury index for bonds.,1
"About 67% of the time, both stocks and bonds provided positive returns; 23% of the time, stocks had a negative return partially offset by positive bond returns; and 8% of the time, stocks had a positive return partially offset by negative bond returns.",0
"In aggregate, the data covers 96 years of 12-month windows.",1
"A 60/40 portfolio produced a positive 12-month return 80% of the time, as shown in Exhibits 24 and 25.",0
Another challenge put forth by the naysayers to the viability of 60/40 portfolios has been the recent positive correlation between stocks and bonds.,0
The correlation between stocks and bonds has been positive since August 2022.,0
"As shown in Exhibit 26, this correlation has varied over time.",1
We have looked at both three-year and 10-year rolling windows.,0

 23 Outlook Investment Strategy Group the average correlation has been negative at -0.33.,0
The correlations over 10-year rolling windows exhibit the same pattern of positive and negative correlations.,0
"The changing correlation between stocks and bonds, however, has no bearing on the viability of 60/40 portfolios.",0
"Typically, investors expect bonds to provide some downside protection during large declines in equity prices.",0
Bonds have done so even when the correlation between stocks and bonds has been positive.,0
"Exhibit 27 shows how bonds have had positive returnsalbeit small returns at times during equity market downdrafts, in effect partly hedging the returns of the portfolio even when the correlations were positive.",0
We conclude that negative returns for stocks and bonds and positive correlations between them do not undermine the viability of 60/40 portfolios and should not deter clients from the use of stock/ bond benchmarks as a launching pad for strategic asset allocation.,0
The Last Decade Does Not Imply a Lost Decade A 60/40 portfolio comprising the S&P 500 and the Bloomberg Barclays Intermediate Treasury Index generated an annualized return of 8.0% on a nominal basis and 5.3% on a real basis (adjusted for inflation) over the decade ending in 2022.,0
This compares to an annualized portfolio return of 8.8% in nominal terms and 5.4% in real terms since 1926.,0

"The Strategic Asset Allocation team expects, based on long-term returns driven by its multi-factor model, a 6.2% annualized total return over the next decade.",0
"Building a diversified portfolio based on the reference portfolio is expected to add another 0.75 to 1.0 percentage point to returns, as we discuss below.",0
Diversified Model Portfolios Built Upon a Reference Portfolio of Stocks and Bonds Appropriate diversification is another pillar of ISGs investment philosophy.,1
"We recommend diversifying assets away from generic stocks and bonds into other assets, but only if those assets improve the risk/return profile of a portfolio.",0
"For example, one can improve the return and Sharpe ratio of a portfolio by adding high yield securities and illiquid assets such as private equity, real estate and infrastructure to it.",0
We recommend a very limited allocation to hedge funds.,1
"As shown in Exhibit 28, diversification into these other assets is expected to add about 0.7 percentage point to annualized returns and improve the Sharpe ratio of an optimized portfolio from 0.43 to 0.51 relative to a 60/40 reference benchmark.",0
We believe that one can add value to portfolios by introducing certain long-term investment themes.,0
"For example, US Preeminence has been an investment theme since the inception of ISG.",0
We recommend overweighting US equities and meaningfully underweighting emerging market assets.,0

 25 Outlook Investment Strategy Group view that diversified portfolios should overweight US assets and underweight emerging market assets and assets with significant exposure to China.,0
"In the interest of brevity, we refer you to that Insight for details.",1
We also recommend avoiding certain asset classes that do not improve the risk/return profile of a portfolio.,0
"Among certain strategic asset allocation advisors, commoditiesespecially oil, natural gas and goldhave become a frequently recommended asset to add to a portfolio given the increase in inflation as well as the strong returns of the energy sector in 2022.",0
We strongly advise against such a strategic allocation.,0
"As explained in our January 2010 Insight report, Commodities: A Solution in Search of a Strategy , neither gold, nor oil, nor commodities in aggregate improve the risk/return profile of a portfolio.",0
"At the time, the prevailing recommendation was to add commodities to portfolios.",1
"As shown in Exhibit 29, US equities have outperformed all key commodities since we published that report.",0
"We still do not recommend commodities, because they do not improve the risk/return profile of a portfolio and, notably, they are among the worst asset classes in outperforming inflation, as shown in Exhibit 30.",0
It is important to note that we differentiate between strategic and tactical asset allocation.,1
"While we do not recommend commodities as part of a clients strategic asset allocation, we have tactically allocated assets to commodities and commodity-related sectors and will continue to do so in the future.",0
"US equities, in fact, are the most effective hedge against inflation relative to other asset classes.",0
This asset class has had the highest frequency of Exhibit 29: Total Return Since the ISG Commodities Insight Publication Commodities have meaningfully lagged US equities since January 2010.,0

We conclude that a 60/40 portfolio is still a good starting point upon which to build a fully diversified portfolio.,0
"A year of negative returns in both asset classes, positive correlations and lower forward returns compared to returns in the prior decade do not negate the benefits of a portfolio that is composed primarily of stocks and bonds and has been supplemented by other asset classes.",0
"As Sir John Templeton, American-British investor, wrote, the four most expensive words in the English language are This time it is different. 16 When market participants say this time is different and suggest that we are entering a new regime in which 60/40 stock/bond portfolios no longer work, we are reminded of Templetons comment and remain confident that history is a useful guide: this time is not that different from past periods of underperformance of stock/bond portfolios and positive correlations.",0
"Since we expect returns for the next one, five, and 10 years to be attractive, we recommend clients stay invested at a well-diversified strategic asset allocation that is in line with their risk tolerance.",0
We now turn to our one- and five-year expected returns across publicly traded asset classes and make the case for staying invested despite the heavy fog ahead.,0
"Our One- and Five-Year Expected Total Returns Given the probability of 4555% that we have assigned to a US recession, with a midpoint at 50%, we are also assigning a 50% probability to the base case scenario of our expected returns across the major publicly traded asset classes.",0
"We are assigning a higher probability to the downside scenarios, given the combined risks of recession and geopolitical flare-ups around the world.",0
This is the lowest probability we have given our base case scenario and the highest probability we have given our downside scenario since the GFC (see Exhibit 31).,0
"Our expected returns are driven by our estimates of: Below-trend global growth of 2.4% in 2023, consisting of 1.2% growth in the US, mild recessions in the Eurozone and the UK, anemic growth in Brazil, below-trend growth in India and a recession in Russia because of the war in Ukraine.",0

"As shown in Exhibit 32, we expect US and Eurozone equities to be the best-performing asset classes in 2023, with total returns in local currency of about 13% in our base case scenario.",0
We expect returns of 12% for the MSCI All Country World Index.,0
"Such strong equity returns, if realized, will result in moderate-risk model portfolio returns of 9.0% for taxable clients and 9.8% for tax-exempt clients.",0
"As mentioned earlier, we assign a probability of 50% to our base case scenario.",1
"We assign a probability of 30%, much higher than usual, to our downside scenario across all equity markets.",0
"However, in the US, the full-year returns in our downside scenario are relatively muted, at -4%, because US equities already declined 18% in 2022.",0
Valuations declined from 21.4x consensus earnings at the beginning of 2022 to 17.4x by the end of the year.,0
"In our upside scenario, we expect equities to increase by as much as 27% due to lower inflation, above-trend growth in the US and higher multiples as investors are relieved that recession risks have abated.",0
"We assign a 20% probability to that case, as shown in Exhibit 33.",0
We estimate that our one- and five-year return expectations will be realized even if we have a mild US recession that ends this year.,0
The most important question to address for clients is why we recommend they stay invested at their strategic asset allocation given the 4555% probability of recession and 30% probability of our downside scenario.,0

" 28 Goldman Sachs january 2023 First and foremost, while we have assigned a 30% probability to a muted -4% return for the full year, we have assigned a 70% probability of S&P 500 returns of 13% or higher.",0
"The skew of expected returns by the end of 2023 is to the upside, based on our analysis.",0
"Second, ISGs framework for underweighting equities in the face of a high probability of recession requires that equity markets have not declined more than 10%.",0
"As shown in Exhibit 34, if the probability of recession is highwhich it is currentlybut the equity market has already declined significantly, it is too late to underweight equities; in fact, we look for opportunities to overweight equities, either directly or through options.",0
Our framework to underweight equities in anticipation of a recession is based on post-WWII history showing equity markets do not typically discount recessions more than six months in advance.,0
What transpired in 2022 was unusual on multiple frontsnot just because having a year with negative returns for both stocks and bonds has occurred only 2% of the time since 1926.,0
Other rare occurrences also materialized last year.,0
"As mentioned earlier, our most historically reliable leading indicator for detecting a future recession, our Yield Curve Inversion Diffusion Index, triggered a recession signal on July 25, 2022.",0
"At that time, US equities had already declined 17% from peak levels earlier in the year.",0
"Typically, equities have declined by low- to mid-single digits at the time of past signals, allowing time for defensive portfolio adjustments (see Exhibit 35).",0
The largest decline prior to 2022 was 9%.,0
So underweighting equities after a decline of 18% in 2022 is not prudent given our view that a recession is not a certainty and the fact that a significant market decline preceded the recession signal in this cycle.,0
"Similarly, the equity market has rallied after the start of every Federal Reserve tightening cycle that led to a recession.",0
"As shown in Exhibit 36, the S&P 500 has rallied after the beginning of all tightening cycles by anywhere from 4% to 85%, with an average of 40% and a median of 34%.",0
"(We have included the tightening cycle that started in 2015, even though the pandemic triggered the following recession.)",0
"Therefore, the beginning of a tightening cycle is not reason enough to underweight equities.",0
"In 2022, the equity market had already declined 10% by the time of the first hike by the Federal Reserve in March.",0
It is very unusual for financial conditions to tighten as much as they did in 2022 before the Federal Reserve raises rates.,0
The third reason we recommend clients stay invested at their strategic asset allocation is that portfolio returns after a year of negative returns such as we had in 2022tend to be higher than long-term averages in the following 12 and 24 months.,0
We shared some of this analysis in defense of 60/40 portfolios.,1
Here we examine the data for Exhibit 34: ISG Decision Matrix for Underweighting Equities We believe investors are better off staying the course and even looking for opportunities to overweight stocks.,0

"We note the following: As shown in Exhibit 37, negative returns for a moderate-risk portfolio occur only 18% of the time.",0
" Typically, as shown in Exhibit 38, the markets subsequent returns outperform long-term averages after a big decline.",0
"For example, in the post-WWII period, the total return of a 50/50 portfolio was 10.6% in the 12 months following a negative return, compared to the average annual return of 8.9%.",0
The returns are even more compelling over 24 months.,0

"During the Great Depression, a moderate-risk portfolio would have experienced a cumulative drawdown of 53% for 2.8 years.",0
"A moderate-risk portfolio took 3.6 years to recover to prior peak levels, as shown in Exhibit 39.",0

"We do not believe those periods are likely to be repeated: Monetary policy discipline was very different in the early 1970s, oil prices increased by nearly 2.5 times and inflation expectations became unanchored.",0
" In the dot-com bubble period, equity valuations were significantly higher.",0

"At peak levels, we had 22 individual tactical tilts in 2022, compared to a long-term average of 10 tilts a year.",0
"Typically, these tactical tilts have been funded from fixed income assets and driven by attractive valuations and market dislocations.",0
"Volatile markets tend to provide more market dislocations, which, in turn, provide more opportunities for tactical asset allocation.",0

" 33 Outlook Investment Strategy Group We estimate that these tilts added about 50 basis points to a taxable moderate-risk portfolio in 2022, outperforming intermediate Treasury and municipal bonds.",0
"The overall volatility of the tilts was 5.1%, and the beta to the S&P 500 was 0.18.",0
Despite the positive beta to the S&P 500 which dropped about 18% for the yearthe tilts produced a positive total return.,0
S&P 500 Option Strategies: One of the most effective strategies in 2022 for taking advantage of increased volatility was using options to augment the returns of a fully invested portfolio.,0
The strategy is based on two tenets: Volatility tends to revert to its long-term average over time.,0
"If volatility spikes because of events such as the GFC, the pandemic or the Russian invasion of Ukraine, it eventually comes back toward its long-term average of about 20 as measured by the VIX.",0
"During the early months of the pandemic, for example, volatility reached 85.",0
"In 2022, it peaked at 39 intraday and ended the year at 22, as shown in Exhibit 48.",0
"When volatility is high, options increase in value, and that may be an opportune time to sell options.",0
"When volatility is low, that may be an opportune time to buy options.",0
 We tend to use options to enhance the risk/ return profile of a portfolio when we believe that buying or selling the underlying asset is a riskier strategy.,0
"For example, if volatility is high and we can collect an attractive premium by selling a put option, that may be more attractive than buying the asset outright.",0
"Sometimes, we use a combination of options, as we did in 2022.",1
"In 2022, we had a total of nine put and call option tactical tilts on the S&P 500.",1
"In aggregate, they produced a total return of 3.2% net of transaction Exhibit 48: Daily Implied S&P 500 Volatility Extreme levels of volatility increase attractiveness of option strategies.",0

Note: 50/50 portfolio refers to 50% US equity/50% US intermediate bonds.,1
Bonds are represented by US intermediate treasuries and equities by the S&P 500 Index.,1
Episodes correspond to historical monthly drawdowns of more than -20% during the post-war era.,0

" 34 Goldman Sachs january 2023 costs, with a volatility of 6%, compared to the total return of the S&P 500 of -18%, total return of intermediate Treasuries of -8% and total return of intermediate municipal bonds of -5%.",0
"While we do not have any such S&P 500 options as a tactical tilt in early 2023, we expect this to be an effective tactical asset allocation strategy this year, as spikes in volatility are likely given the uncertainty ahead with respect to the US economy and geopolitical tensions.",0
"As of year-end 2022, we had six tactical tilts, which is below our average number of tilts and is the lowest level of risk allocated to such tilts over the last decade.",0
Overweight 2-Year Treasuries: We initiated a tactical tilt to a constant-maturity 2-year Treasury early in 2022.,0
"At the time, our view was that 2-year Treasury rates were already discounting Federal Reserve tightening to such an extent that the tilt was likely to provide a positive return.",0
"We still expect the tilt to provide a positive return, especially as 2-year Treasury rates ended 2022 at 4.4%.",0
"Given our view of economic growth at 1.2% and the federal funds rate peaking at 55.25%, we expect this tilt to provide a mid-single-digit return in 2023.",0
18 Overweight US Energy Infrastructure Master Limited Partnerships: The allocation to master limited partnerships (MLPs) has been one of our longest-standing tactical tilts.,0
It was initiated as an option tilt in 2015 and changed to a long sector position in January 2016.,1
This tilt has an inception-to-date return of 37% and has been one of our most volatile tilts.,0
"The MLP sector was up nearly 30% in 2022, compared to the S&P 500 at -18%.",0
"While we have reduced the allocation to this tilt given its strong performance over the last two years, we still retain an allocation, for the following reasons: Valuations are still attractive even after such strong returns.",0
Valuations as measured by the ratio of enterprise value to EBITDA are one standard deviation below their long-term average due to continued strong earnings (see Exhibit 49).,0
" Corporate management has continued to be disciplined about capital expenditures, with 2022 levels about 3.9% below 2021 levels.",0
2023 levels are expected to be flat to slightly lower.,0
 The tax-advantaged distribution yield of 8% is attractive compared to fixed income and high yield rates.,0
"The companies in the Alerian MLP Infrastructure Index generate 1.8x free cash flow relative to distributions, so the distribution yield appears secure.",0
 We expect returns in the low 20s in 2023.,0
"We note that we removed our S&P 500 energy sector tilt in October 2022 as the sector had rallied 63%, following a 55% total return in 2021.",0
The energy sector had outperformed the S&P 500 by 83 percentage points when we removed the tilt.,0
"We removed the tilt because it had reached fair value on a normalized price-to-earnings basis, given oil prices in the futures market.",0
Overweight Eurozone Banks: We have maintained our tactical tilt to Eurozone banks at a reduced allocation.,0
"This is also among our longest-standing tilts, initiated in June 2018.",1
"And very much like our MLP tilt, it has been very volatile.",0
"It outperformed the European markets in both 2021, with a total return of 42%, and 2022, with a total return of 2%.",0
We retain this allocation for the following reasons: Rising rates will improve the banks net interest margins and overall profitability.,0
 We expect only a moderate rise in provisions despite our recession forecast for the Eurozone.,0
"Leverage has remained low, and two-thirds of the post-COVID increase in lending is covered Exhibit 49: MLP Enterprise Value to EBITDA MLP valuations are still attractive even after strong returns over the least 2 years.",0

"There are currently no signs of deterioration in asset quality, as shown in Exhibit 50.",1
 The banks capital ratio is near record highs.,0
" We expect a total return in the low 20s, composed of 6% dividend yield and multiple expansion as the price-to-book ratio increases from its current low level of 0.60x to 0.69x.",0
"As shown by the red triangle in Exhibit 51, that increase in price-to-book is a reasonable assumption.",0
"Allocation to US Natural Gas Calendar Spread: As noted earlier, both European and US natural gas prices gyrated following the halting of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline and the Russian invasion of Ukraine.",0
Fears of winter shortages of natural gas led US March 2023 contracts to become very expensive relative to April and trade at a historically high premium of over $1 per million BTU (see Exhibit 52)a spread that had been wider only 9% of the time.,0
This spread has typically contracted to $0.5 or less 95% of the time as the winter ends.,0
"The base case expected return on this trade was in the mid- to high teens, and we are rapidly approaching those levels.",0
Allocation to Physical Uranium: We initiated a small allocation to physical uranium in 2022.,1
"Nuclear energy is becoming an increasingly attractive source of electricity as countries seek reliable, carbon-free and secure sources of energy.",0
Some view nuclear energy as a permanent solution and others as a transition source of energy away from hydrocarbons while waiting for the development of more renewable energy sources.,0
Nuclear energy has supplied about 20% of total annual US electricity since 1990.,1
"In 2020, nuclear energy supplied 69% of Frances electricity generation.",1

 36 Goldman Sachs january 2023 There has been a sharp decrease in uranium exploration activity and in production from existing mines.,0
"Since 2018, mined supply has been insufficient to meet annual reactor requirements (see Exhibit 53), and utilities have accessed inventories and extended the enrichment process to extract more yield per unit of raw uranium.",0
"As of December 31, 2022, the price for uranium was $48/lb.",1
We estimate that prices need to reach $70 or higher to incentivize adequate future production.,0
"While we do not anticipate those levels in the near term, we think this tilt will have long-term attractive returns.",0
Allocation to Systematic Strategies: We deploy three systematic strategies to provide uncorrelated sources of incremental return to a portfolio: Systematic Upside Improvement Tilt (SUIT); Systematic Downside Mitigation Tilt (SDMT); and Trend-Based Rotation (TBR).,0
All three strategies were deployed at the beginning of 2022.,0
We removed the first two strategies after high-single-digit returns but have left the TBR strategy as a tactical tilt for 2023.,0
This strategy was introduced in 2021.,1
"The goal is to rotate among 10 asset classes: US and non- US equity indices, gold, US corporate bonds, US Treasury bonds and US cash.",1
"The strategy is driven by the trend in each asset class, its volatility and the likelihood the trend will reverse course once it has become extended.",0
The strategy is based on the momentum factor and is a diversified strategy for ISGs more value-oriented tactical tilts.,0
We generally expect the strategy to deliver a high- single-digit return.,0
Role of Growth Stocks in Driving Equity Returns: Our tactical tilts generally have had a value orientation.,0
"Since the inception of ISG, we have had only a handful of growth-oriented tactical tilts.",0
"In total, our tactical tilts have provided incremental return to the strategic asset allocation process.",0
"Avoiding growth-oriented sectors did not hamper our performance, or that of the S&P 500.",0
"One of the questions clients most frequently ask us concerns the role of a limited basket of stocks like the FANGMANT stocks, or the technology or communication sector stocks, in driving equity returns since the GFC.",0
"When we share our view that the return of the S&P 500 has been broad- based, clients are often surprised.",0
"As shown in Exhibit 54, the FANGMANT stocks represent 20% of the weight in the S&P 500 Index, down from a peak of 29% in November 2021.",0
"The most straightforward way to show that a handful of growth stocks with large weights in the S&P 500 have not driven the index returns is to compare these returns using market capitalization weights to those of an equal-weighted index of stocks, where value stocks like Exxon, with Exhibit 53: Annual Uranium Mine Production and Nuclear Reactor Requirements The current trajectory of mine production is projected to remain below annual reactor requirements.",0

We have analyzed the data through the end of 2021 and end of 2022.,1
"We present below the returns of the two benchmarks for four periods: since March 2000, the peak of the dot-com bubble; since the trough of the GFC; and over the last five and the last 10 years.",0
We focus on the data ending in 2021 because these stocks did extremely poorly in 2022 and we do not want clients to discount the analysis because of that poor performance.,0
Late 2021 also marks the peak weight of the basket of FANGMANT stocks in the S&P 500 Index.,0
This basket of stocks declined 40% in 2022.,0
"Since 2000 and since the trough of the GFC, the equal-weighted index outperformed the market capitalization index by 2.21 and 0.94 percentage points, respectively, on an annualized basis.",0
"Over the decade ending in 2021, the market capitalization-weighted index outperformed by 0.92 percentage point.",0
"The outperformance increased to 2.75 percentage points over the five years ending in 2021, and that includes the strong outperformance during the pandemic (see Exhibit 55).",0
"If the returns had been driven by a basket of growth-oriented stocks alone, the equal-weighted index would have lagged the market capitalization-weighted index significantly over all periods.",0
An alternative approach is to look at the total return across all S&P 500 Index sectors.,1
"As shown in Exhibit 56, the information technology sector outperformed after the trough of the GFC.",0
"However, financials, industrials and health care all outperformed the broader market.",0
"While our US Preeminence theme is not reflected in a tactical asset allocation tilt, it is a strategic asset allocation overweight.",0

" 42 Goldman Sachs january 2023 Additional Risks to Our Outlook We face significantly greater risks in 2023 than we did in 2022: In 2022, we assigned a 10% probability of recession in the US; we have increased that probability to 4555% for 2023.",0
" We wrote that the late Ash Carter, former US secretary of defense, had assigned a 50% probability to the risk of a Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022.",0
"Now, not only has that happened, but we are facing risk of escalation, including attacks on infrastructure beyond Ukraines borders and a nonzero probability of tactical nuclear weapon deployment.",0
 We wrote that US-China relations were going to be a source of uncertainty and volatility for the indefinite future; China became more aggressive in both its policy statements and its military activities in 2022.,0
" With respect to North Korea, we wrote that we were least worried about rising tensions in 2022, but now we are worried about Kim Jong Uns more aggressive posture toward missile testing and North Koreas nuclear capabilities.",0
 We wrote about two risks with respect to Iran: continued development of its nuclear program and its extensive missile program.,0
The risks are even greater now given Irans further enrichment of its uranium and its new military partnership with Russia.,0
" On COVID, we highlighted the risks of a more transmissible variant and risks to supply chains from Chinas zero-COVID policy.",0
The risks from COVID are unchanged.,1
"The new XBB.1.5 omicron subvariant has become the dominant variant in parts of the US, and Chinas disorderly abandonment of its zero-COVID policy may create another surge of infections in other parts of the world.",0
 We did not cite US midterm elections as a risk in 2022.,1
"However, the US will be a source of volatility in the second half of 2023: US debt ceiling negotiations are likely to be contentious and lead to market volatility, as they have in the past.",0
"In aggregate, we think the risks to our economic and financial market outlook are greater than in 2022.",0
"We begin with the geopolitical risks, since the recession risks were discussed earlier.",1
"We have consulted on these risks with Andrew Bishop, senior partner and global head of policy research at Signum Global Advisors; Ian Bremmer, president and founder of Eurasia Group; General Sir Nick Carter, former chief of the Defence Staff in the UK; Bernie Haykel, professor of Near Eastern studies at Princeton University; and Sir Alex Younger, former chief of the Secret Intelligence Service in the UK and regional advisor at Goldman Sachs.",0
Ukraine-Russia War The base case for most of the geopolitical advisors we have consulted with is a war that will last well beyond 2023.,0
"There is no face-saving off-ramp for President Vladimir Putin, and Ukraine cannot readily come to the negotiating table after the war crimes committed by the Russians against men, women and children, and the extensive damage to civilian structures and infrastructure.",0
"The greatest risk is escalation by the Russians: Russian could become more aggressive, targeting infrastructure such as undersea cables and pipelines outside Ukraine.",0
 Russia could launch cyberattacks globally.,0
" Russia, most importantly, could use its nuclear capabilities.",0
" Russia has the ability to use the ruse of a dirty bomb as a false flag somewhere near the Russian border to undermine Ukraines position, according to General Sir Nick Carter.",0
19 It could use a small-scale tactical nuclear weapon with limited explosive yield in Ukraine.,1
 It could use a nuclear weapon to generate a high-altitude electromagnetic pulse that would damage electronics and communication systems.,1
The geopolitical advisors we have consulted with expect the Ukraine- Russia war to last well beyond 2023.,0
" 43 Outlook Investment Strategy Group According to Bremmer, the US has told Russia that if it were to deploy a nuclear weapon, the US would directly target Russian forces.",0
"20 Theoretically, that warning should be a sufficient deterrent to President Putin.",0
"However, Sir Alex warns that we cannot rely on Putin to act rationally.",0
He has a higher readiness to accept risk. 21 Bremmer has assigned a 5% probability to use of nuclear weapons.,0
"Financially, Russia can afford to prolong this war through 2023 and possibly through 2024.",0
"We base this assessment on a series of assumptions, such as: A modest GDP decline in Russia of 3% in 2022 relative to high-single-digit drop expectations Equally modest GDP decline of 2.6% in 2023 Oil and gas exports continuing at year-end 2022 levels China and India continuing to import 24% and 11%, respectively, of Russias export of crude oil and refined products Russias ability to issue bonds domestically and tap oligarchs, their companies and the sovereign wealth fund, which has an estimated $186 billion in assets One factor constraining how long Russia can continue the war is its supply of artillery ammunition.",0
"Admiral Sir Tony Radakin has said that Russia faces critical shortages of artillery munitions, 22 and US officials have made similar statements.",0
"The Wagner Group, a Russian mercenary company, has also complained about the lack of ammunition.",0
23 Others have countered that Russia can tap into Soviet-era stockpiles and import ammunition from North Korea.,0
"Finally, a cutoff of the Wests military, financial and humanitarian support to Ukraine would increase the likelihood that Ukraine would be forced to negotiate a settlement of some kind.",0
"While some have questioned the resolve of the US and Europe, it appears that their resolve has only strengthened.",0
"Ukraine has received increasing funds, more sophisticated military equipment and stronger statements of support from most Western leaders.",0
Europe is also under limited pressure to resume imports of natural gas from Russia.,0
"Germany, in less than a year from the start of construction, inaugurated its first floating liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal in Wilhelmshaven, and accepted its first shipment of LNG from the US.",0
The terminal can process close to 6% of Germanys 2021 consumption level.,1
"Coincidentally, the US is fast becoming the largest exporter of LNG, as shown in Exhibit 73.",0

"US-China Tensions As discussed extensively in our China Insight report, Middle Kingdom: Middle Income , China has become more aggressive and assertive in its foreign policy toward the West.",0
The US and its allies have responded by changing their national security strategies; they have introduced export and import controls such as the US Bureau of Industry and Securitys revision of export controls of high- end semiconductors and enhanced cybersecurity measures.,0
Please see the report for a detailed discussion on this topic.,1
We think financial market volatility emanating from US-China tensions will ebb and flow.,0
"The meeting between Presidents Biden and Xi on November 14, 2022, in Bali, Indonesia, and the appointment of the Chinese ambassador to the US as foreign minister on December 30, 2022, have been interpreted as an improvement in US-China relations.",0
"On the other hand, a series of military activities in December 2022 have been interpreted as a more aggressive approach: The Japanese Ministry of Defense reported that between December 17 and December 27, the Chinese aircraft carrier Liaoning and its accompanying vessels sailed near the southernmost part of Japan and that there were numerous aircraft takeoffs that prompted Japan to scramble military aircraft and vessels.",0
"24 The Lianoning and its task force also proceeded to within 400 miles of the US territory of Guam during this period, and Chinese media highlighted that Guam would be a target in a conflict scenario.",0
" On December 21, the US Indo-Pacific Command reported that a Peoples Liberation Army Navy fighter pilot performed an unsafe maneuver during an intercept of a YOU.S. Air Force RC-135 aircraft in international airspace forcing the RC-135 to take evasive maneuvers to avoid a collision. 25 On December 25, China sent 71 warplanes into the vicinity of Taiwan, of which 47 crossed into Taiwans southwest air defense identification zone, prompting Taiwans military to respond with aircraft and navy vessels.",0
The level of such incursions doubled in 2022 relative to 2021.,0
"26 While US-China tensions and increased risks of military accidents in the air and the seas may contribute to market volatility, our panel of geopolitical advisors believe that the risk of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan is low in 2023.",0

"North Korea While we were not worried about North Koreas activities spilling into financial markets in 2022, we think North Korea poses greater risks in 2023.",0
"As shown in Exhibit 74, North Korea has launched more missiles in 2022 than in the prior five years combined.",0
The missiles have varied from short- range ballistic missiles to intercontinental ones.,1
"CIA Director William Burns has referred to it as quite troubling, and Bremmer has warned that they are going to test a nuke. 27 Eurasia Group has also written that the chances of conflict on the Korean peninsula are at their highest level since at least 2017 with fewer guardrails in place to promote de-escalation. 28 China and Russia would have been the countries to place some guardrails on North Korea, but given the Ukraine-Russia war and rising geopolitical tensions between the US and China, those guardrails have been removed.",0
"While risks of incidents between South Korea and North Korea are non-negligible in 2023, and missile tests could lead to interim volatility in the financial markets, the risk of serious military engagement with North Korea is low in the near term.",0
Iran Iran poses two threats in 2023: producing weapons- grade uranium and making other irreversible advances in its nuclear program and expanding its weapons sales to Russia from drones to missiles.,0
Nuclear Concerns.,1
"According to data from the International Atomic Energy Agency and the analysis from the Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS), Iran already has highly enriched uranium (HEU) at 60% sufficient to be used for a nuclear weapon.",1
"29 However, ISIS thinks Iran may prefer to enrich its 60% HEU to 90%, which is considered weapons-grade and more suited to Irans nuclear weapons designs.",0
General Sir Nick has suggested Iran will very likely have reinforced its view from observing the Ukraine war that there is merit is possessing a nuclear deterrent.,0
30 Sir Alex suggests that Irans leaders will not weaponize because their progress on enrichment gives them enough leverage. 31 Eurasia Group writes that Iran might decide to enrich to 90% when the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) restrictions on Irans development program of ballistic missiles designed to carry nuclear weapons expire in October 2023.,0

Transferring Drones and Missiles to Russia.,1
The new military relationship between Russia and Iran has been troubling to the West.,0
"Burns has said that what is beginning to emerge is at least the beginning of a full-fledged defense partnership between Russia and Iran, with the Iranians supplying drones to the Russians, which are killing Ukrainian civilians. 33 In a joint statement after a United Nations Security Council meeting, France, Germany and the UK warned Iran against any further deliveries of weapons to Russia, in particular of any short-range ballistic missiles, which would constitute a serious escalation. 34 In our 2022 Outlook , we quoted Kenneth Frank McKenzie Jr., Marine general and commander of the US Central Command covering the Middle East and South Asia; he said that Iran had reached overmatch where its strategic capacity is now enormous and it has the ability to overwhelm. Its missiles can strike effectively across the breadth and depth of the Middle East with accuracy and volume. 35 The joint statement warned that transferring such missiles to Russia would constitute an escalation.",0
Escalation would lead to market volatility.,0
"Cybersecurity Cyberattacks remain a major threat from state and non-state actors, with the biggest threats emanating from China, Russia, Iran and North Korea.",0
US intelligence and national security agencies assess Chinas state-sponsored cyber activities as presenting one of the largest and most dynamic threats to US government and civilian networks.,0
"The Office of the Director of National Intelligence considers Russia a significant threat given its focus on critical infrastructure, including underwater cables and industrial control systems, in the US and in allies and partner countries.",0
36 Use of ransomware is on the rise as well and will continue increasing in 2023.,0
"Australia will lead a global ransomware task force starting in January 2023 to develop safeguards for advanced economies, but the benefits of such a task force will not be immediate.",0
Terrorism Our panel of experts believe that the risk of terrorism is unchanged from 2022.,0
"They cite the absence of charismatic leaders and the lack of command and control under which terror groups could operate from the Middle East, including in Afghanistan.",0
"With limited state sponsorship, terror groups cannot get adequate funding to organize and pull off major terrorist acts in the West.",0
General Sir Nick has warned that there is a real possibility of terrorism being exported on the back of migration from Africa.,0
"The assessment of the Combating Terrorism Center at West Point is that the threat of terrorism from Africa and the Middle East is more local and cross-border within the region than global, with Africa emerging as the worlds leading terrorism hotspot. 37 COVID-19 COVID-19 risks in advanced economies are unchanged from last year.",0
"A new omicron subvariant, XBB1.5, has become the dominant variant in the US Northeast and could be responsible for the current surge.",0
"However, holiday travel and the winter may also be contributing to the surge.",0
This variant appeared in Singapore in the fall.,0
The new variant has been described as immune-evasive: the virus is less likely to be neutralized by antibodies from prior infection or vaccines.,0
"According to Dr. David Ho, professor of microbiology and immunology at Columbia University, the level of immune evasion is alarming. 38 Our COVID-19 advisor, Dr. Luciana Borio, former director for medical and biodefense preparedness at the US National Security Council, believes that the new variant will cause many more infections, but that T cells from prior infections and vaccinations will limit serious disease and hospitalizations for most people.",0
Cyberattacks remain a major threat from state and non-state actors.,0
 47 Outlook Investment Strategy Group China is going through its massive first wave of COVID since the initial controlled surge in Wuhan in 2020.,0
"According to reports in the Financial Times , Sun Yang, a deputy director at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), estimated that about 250 million peopleor 18% of Chinas populationwere infected by COVID-19 in the first 20 days of December 2022.",0
"39 Wu Zunyou, chief epidemiologist at the Chinese CDC, has suggested China will face three waves: the present one, a second one following the travel of hundreds of millions of people for the Lunar New Year starting on January 21, 2023, and a third one from late February to mid-March when people return to work from the New Year holidays.",0
40 The University of Washingtons Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation has estimated that China could see as many as 1 million COVID- related deaths.,0
41 Dr. Borio believes that the focus on variants emerging from Chinas abandonment of its zero- COVID policy is understandable but not fully justified.,0
"While Chinas removal of all COVID restrictions, including travel restrictions inside and outside China, may increase COVID infections outside China, we do not expect the risks to meaningfully affect the financial markets.",0
"US Debt Ceiling David Mericle and Alec Phillips, our colleagues in Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research, have highlighted raising the debt ceiling in 2023 as a significant risk to equity and bond markets.",0
The debt ceiling limits how much debt the Treasury can issue to fund the US government and meet its coupon and principal payment obligations.,1
"The US is expected to reach its debt limit by August 2023, but it may be as late as October.",0
"Mericle and Phillips suggest that the political and fiscal conditions this year will be similar to the conditions in 1995 and 2011, when the US had to raise the debt limit and the process was extremely disruptive. 42 In both those periods, a sitting Democratic president faced a Republican House which had won the majority after the midterm election, and federal debt as a share of GDP had increased at a more rapid pace.",0
The debt limit standoffs between Republicans and Democrats led to increased market volatility in both periods.,0
"Prices of Treasury securities with maturities around the date of the debt ceiling dropped, and worries about a default increased.",0
Mericle and Phillips point out that the process to elect a speaker of the House provides some insight into how the debt ceiling negotiations may transpire.,0
We conclude that there is no shortage of risks that could derail our economic and financial market outlook.,0
China is going through its massive first wave of COVID since the initial controlled surge in Wuhan in 2020.,0
" 48 Goldman Sachs january 2023 Key Takeaways While we are facing a period of heightened uncertainty after a tumultuous 2022, we believe our two primary investment themes remain valid: US Preeminence and Staying Invested.",0
US Preeminence leads us to overweight US assets in our strategic asset allocation.,0
Staying Invested drives our recommendation that clients maintain their strategic asset allocation; that recommendation will change if we develop high conviction that a recession is imminent and not already discounted by the market.,0
"Currently, we do not have high conviction that a recession is imminent and one has already been partially discounted by the equity market decline.",0
The key takeaways from our 2023 Outlook are as follows: Below-Trend Growth: We expect global economic growth to slow to below-trend levels.,0
"We believe the US will have modest growth; the Eurozone, the UK and Russia will be in recession; and that Japan will be an exception with above-trend growth.",0
"Large emerging market countries will grow below trend at mid-single-digit growth levels, in our view.",0
"We estimate Chinas post-COVID recovery will reach 4.9%, just above trend levels of 44.5%.",0
 Monetary Policy Tightening: We believe that most major central banks will continue tightening monetary policy but at a more modest pace than in 2022.,0
China will be a key exception as the leadership tries to stem the declines in the property sector.,0
 Recession Risk in the US: We have assigned a 4555% range to the risk of recession in 2023.,0
"We believe the fog of uncertainty is too great to have much conviction on the direction of the US economy, and we therefore recommend clients position their portfolios neither for the certainty",0
 49 Outlook Investment Strategy Group of recession nor for the certainty of modest growth in the US.,0
The framework for staying invested is best captured by Exhibit 75.,1
"If the equity market has already largely discounted a recession, history has repeatedly shown that investors are better off staying the course given forward returns have typically been attractive.",0
 Attractive High-Single- Digit Portfolio Returns: We expect high-single-digit returns on a well-diversified moderate-risk portfolio.,0
The returns are driven by equity returns of over 10% in developed markets and 9% in emerging markets.,0
We expect mid-single-digit returns in fixed income assets.,0
" Significant Geopolitical Risks: We face a much longer litany of geopolitical risks this year, including an escalation of the Russia-Ukraine war, high US- China tensions, more ballistic missile testing by North Korea, a growing partnership between Iran and Russia, continued nuclear enrichment in Iran and debt ceiling negotiations in the US.",0
" Vigilance: In the face of fog, we diligently watch for hazards and will remain tactical to take advantage of market opportunities.",0

" 50 Goldman Sachs january 2023 2023 Global Economic Outlook: A Difficult Balancing Act SECTION I I around the world, policymakers are attempting to cross a tightrope.",0
"For global central banks, the challenge is to lift interest rates high enough to dampen growth and bring down inflation, but not so high that they because undue economic fallout.",0
"Similarly, governments are seeking to administer enough fiscal stimulus to help consumers cope with high prices but not so much that they stoke even worse inflation in the process.",0
"In both cases, leaning too far in either direction could be harmful.",0
"To be sure, the risk of a misstep is high.",0
Global central banks collectively delivered more than 280 interest rate hikes last year in response to inflation that was both higher and more persistent than expected.,0
43 Such forceful tightening of monetary policy clearly raises the risk of recession.,0
"At the same time, already stretched fiscal finances and fragile bond markets limit",0
" 52 Goldman Sachs january 2023 the scope for additional fiscal stimulus, as the negative reaction of the UK gilt market to the governments expansionary budget last year reminds us.",0
Additional stimulus is particularly constrained today because countries representing almost three-quarters of the worlds GDP have annual budget deficits greater than 4%.,0
Europe and the UK alone have deployed more than $750 billion of fiscal stimulus to offset the impacts of the war in Ukraine.,0
"44 Still, a sure-footed crossing cannot be ruled out.",0
"We place even odds on the US avoiding a recession this year, as households still have a savings cushion, and the US economy lacks the obvious cyclical excesses seen on the eve of past economic downturns.",0
"In Japan, the economy should continue to expand at an above-trend pace given still-accommodative policy, as well as considerable excess savings.",0
"Meanwhile, emerging markets as a group are likely to grow slightly faster than they did in 2022 as they benefit from Chinas uneven reopening.",0
"The Eurozones outlook, on the other hand, is shaky.",0
"Russias invasion of Ukraine put acute pressure on the regions energy supplies and growth last year, likely causing a recession in the final months of 2022.",0
The same could be said for the UK.,0
"But we expect relatively shallow recessions in both regions, as the economic slowdown thus far has been better than expected and a mild winter has helped cool energy prices.",0

"Moreover, most economists surveyed by Bloomberg expect a recession in 2023.",0
45 We certainly acknowledge this risk and place elevated 4555% odds on a recession this year.,0
But there are several reasons that recession is not our base case.,0
"First, we estimate households have around $1.5 trillion in excess savings after the largest increase in their holdings of cash and cash equivalents on record (see Exhibit 94).",0
Even households in the bottom of the income distributionwhich tend to be the most economically vulnerableare benefiting from disproportionately strong wage gains (see Exhibit 95) that have enabled them to amass a savings buffer.,0
"As recent Federal Reserve research highlights, these households in the bottom half of the income distribution still held (as of mid- 2022) roughly $350 billion in excess savings about $5,500 per household on average, which is sufficient to fully pay off their liquid debt with room to spare. 46 Second, real DPI is set to rebound this year as many of the drags from 2022including higher gas prices, higher capital gains tax payments and lower transfer payments abate (see Exhibit 96).",0
Our GIR colleagues forecast real DPI will rise a solid 3.5% in 2023.,0
"Finally, as noted earlier, we expect only a modest rise in unemployment, reflecting the still large number of job vacancies per unemployed worker.",0
"Without a strong negative feedback loop between job losses and reduced spending, it will be difficult for recession dynamics to take hold.",0

"It is tempting to blame this string of stronger economic reports for Japans surging headline inflation, which at 3.8% late last year stood near the highest level in three decades.",0
But the rise in inflation has largely been driven by higher energy prices and the sharp depreciation of the yen.,0

"Governor Haruhiko Kuroda had dismissed a wider band on several occasions, while research by BOJ staff found that a wider band could be detrimental to capital spending.",0
Kuroda explained the move as a necessary technical adjustment to the yield curve control (YCC) policy that would improve bond market functioning and the transmission of monetary policy to the real economy.,0
We interpret the move as a small first step toward normalizing the banks highly accommodative policy stance.,0
"Additional steps in that direction are likely this year, ultimately culminating in the removal of the YCC policy and possible exit from the banks negative interest rate policy (NIRP).",0
"Several factors will determine the timing of these steps, including the path of inflation, the outcome of the shunto wage negotiations in March-April, and the views of the yet-to-be-selected next governor who will succeed Kuroda in April.",0

The region should also benefit from an influx of Chinese tourists as travel restrictions are lifted.,0
"Hong Kong is set to be a prime beneficiary, having been the main destination for Chinese tourists prior to the pandemic.",0
But even here the outlook is not uniform.,0
"Slower growth in the US and Europe, along with a global shift from goods to services, will weigh on the recovery in both Korea and Taiwan.",0
"As a result, we expect GDP growth in these countries to slow to around 2% this year from closer to 3% in 2022.",0
"In contrast, India is expected to maintain a solid pace of growth at around 5.6%.",0
"In fact, India is among several countries in Asia that may benefit from the global relocation of supply chains over time.",0
"China China spent much of last year enduring the deleterious effects of its zero-COVID policy, including frequent lockdowns and broad mobility restrictions in response to virus outbreaks.",0
"The result was a significant decline in economic activity, made worse by a slump in the property sector and various regulatory crackdowns on private industries.",0
"Although the government tried to cushion the blow with more infrastructure spending and rate cuts (see Exhibits 107 and 108), GDP growth nonetheless fell from more than 8% in 2021 to an estimated 2.7% last year.",0
That represents the slowest pace of growth since 1976 outside of the initial pandemic shock in 2020and one well below both initial consensus expectations of 5.2% and the governments own growth target of around 5.5%.,0
Chinas decision to begin easing COVID restrictions late last year in response to widespread lockdown protests will have a significant impact on 2023s growth outlook.,0

"It took four months for the initial wave in Hong Kong to subside, while Singapore and Taiwan saw multiple smaller waves after the first surge (see Exhibit 109).",0
"Chinas wave could be even more protracted than those in these countries, as its population has less natural immunity from prior infection and comparatively lower vaccination rates, and its vaccines are considered less effective.",0
"At the same time, Chinas health- care system is not well prepared to handle the surge in patients.",0
"Against this backdrop, we expect economic activity to remain subdued through the first quarter of this year, as people avoid public spaces and factories struggle to find enough healthy workers to run at full capacity.",0
The economy should start to recover by the second quarter of this year as the virus wave recedes.,0
"We expect consumption to drive the rebound on the back of pent-up demand, considerable excess savings (see Exhibit 110) and an improving labor market.",0
Fixed investment should also see a modest lift thanks to the pickup in consumer demand and continued policy support.,0
"But these tailwinds will likely be tempered by slower growth abroad, which will weigh on Chinas exports and depress capital spending in the manufacturing sector.",0
"The property sector also remains an important risk to the outlook, but we believe it will be a smaller drag on GDP than it was last year, particularly given the governments 16-point support plan announced last November.",0
"Overall, we expect the Chinese economy to expand by 4.9% in 2023.",0
"Despite the pickup in growth, inflation pressures should remain muted with headline and core inflation of 2.1% and 1.1%, respectively, both well below the central banks tolerance level of 3%.",0

"Responding to these pressures, the regions central banks exacerbated the economic malaise by aggressively tightening monetary policy.",0
"In the case of Hungary, that amounted to more than a 10-percentage-point increase in the policy rate, while the Czech central bank eroded nearly a quarter of its FX reserves defending the nations currency.",0
"Although growth in the region already slowed sharply last year and current account balances are likely to improve in 2023, risks to the economic outlook remain high, especially if a cold winter intensifies gas shortages.",0
"Even with fiscal support measures, the region is likely to enter a recession early this year.",0
"While this should help bring down inflation, it is likely to remain far enough above central banks targets to limit the scope for rate cuts.",0
"Within the region, the outlook for Russia remains skewed to the downside.",0

"Commodity price volatility has also had an impact, albeit a less uniform one.",0
"In the case of Colombia, Mexico and Brazil, higher oil prices provided a boost to growth, while in the case of Chile, disappointing Chinese copper demand was a significant drag.",0
"Growth in the region is likely to remain subdued in 2023, but the end of central bank tightening and Chinas reopening may offer some reprieve later in the year.",0
"Within the region, Brazils economy grew 3.1% last year, led by a strong recovery in the services sector.",0
Fiscal spending in the run-up to the presidential election and strong commodity prices also helped.,0
"But with its central bank having now taken real policy rates deeply into restrictive territory at nearly 8%, we expect economic growth to slow to just 0.9% this year.",0
"While the further fiscal support proposed by the new administration poses upside risk to this forecast, it would also delay much-needed debt reduction and therefore result in higher borrowing costs.",0
" 66 Goldman Sachs january 2023 SECTION I I I on the road to recovery from the global pandemic, financial markets hit an icy patch last year.",0
"The S&P 500 slid 18%, its largest annual decline since 2008.",0
The wreckage was not limited to US stocks.,1
"At the worst of the downdraft last October, 85% of the primary equity indices tracked by Bloomberg showed a loss for the year.",0
"47 Collectively, those declines amounted to nearly $32 trillion in market value at the time.",0
"48 Even bondswhich typically act as a defensive portfolio assetwere not spared, with the Bloomberg Global Aggregate Bond Index slipping 16%.",0
"This unusual decline in both stocks and bonds, which has occurred less than 2% of the time since 1926, 49 resulted in the fourth-worst loss for a balanced portfolio on record.",0
2023 Financial Markets Outlook: Looking for Traction,0
" 68 Goldman Sachs january 2023 To be sure, many of the key uncertainties from last year remain, including elevated inflation, ongoing geopolitical tensions, and the murky trajectory of the Chinese economy.",0
"The risk of a US recession is also top of mind, especially with central banks continuing to hike policy rates and many recession indicators already flashing red.",0
"These are legitimate concerns, and we accordingly give a US recession this year even odds.",0
"But we also should not lose sight of the fact that markets are forward-looking, meaning they typically fall in anticipation of bad news but begin recovering even as the headlines of the day remain ominous.",0
This has two important implications for 2023.,0
"First, risk assets are likely to deliver attractive returns if a US recession is avoided, given the extent of last years losses.",0
"Second, even in the event of a mild US recession that ends this year, stocks could still deliver positive returns, considering the sizable rallies seen in the final months of past economic downturns.",0
"Since not all paths in a recession lead to stock market losses at the end of 2023, we believe the odds of positive US equity returns exceed those of a recession this year.",0
This also explains why we expect gains in Eurozone and UK equities even though we believe these regions are already in recession (see Exhibit 111).,0
Our base case implies financial markets can regain traction in 2023.,0
"In equities, we see more paths to gains than losses by year-end.",0
"Bonds are also expected to rise, as todays higher yields provide an ample cushion to absorb any further increase in interest rates.",0
But there will no doubt be curves along the road ahead.,0
US Equities: Down but Not Out Few investors will lament the passing of 2022.,0
"US equities lost nearly $13 trillion in market capitalization last year, roughly equivalent to the combined GDP of Japan, Germany and the UK.",0
Last years rout was also the second equity bear market in the last three years.,0
"But unlike 2020, there was no speedy recovery last year.",0
"Instead, US equities spent nearly the entirety of the year mired in a double-digit drawdown that ranked among the most persistent downtrends in history (see Exhibit 112).",0
The decline in stocks is understandable considering the bounty of concerns today.,0
"Recession is chief among these, as investors worry that the Exhibit 111: ISG Global Equity ForecastsYear-End 2023 2022 YE End 2023 Central Case Target Range Implied Upside from End 2022 Levels Current Dividend Yield Implied Total Return S&P 500 (US) 3,840 4,2004,300 912% 1.8% 1114% Euro Stoxx 50 (Eurozone) 3,794 4,0004,300 513% 3.6% 917% FTSE 100 (UK) 7,452 7,8008,000 57% 3.9% 911% TOPIX (Japan) 1,892 2,0002,100 611% 2.6% 814% MSCI THEM (Emerging Markets) 956 9901,040 49% 3.0% 712% Data as of December 31, 2022.",0

 69 Outlook Investment Strategy Group combination of tighter monetary policy and below- trend growth necessary to bring down inflation will also tip the US economy into contraction.,0
"That fear is reinforced by the cautionary signals emanating from a host of leading indicators, such as widespread yield curve inversions and the abrupt downturn in the housing market.",0
There is also an unusual consensus among economists that a recession is likely (see Exhibit 113).,0
"Given this backdrop, our expectation for positive equity returns in 2023 may seem counterintuitive (see Exhibit 114).",0
"After all, how can we assign a combined 70% probability to favorable equity outcomes while also placing even odds to a recession this year?",0
"To understand, it is helpful to look at both the soft landing and hard landing scenarios.",0
"If recession is avoided, we expect mid-single- digit nominal GDP growth to lift earnings by 46% this year, providing support for higher equity prices.",0
"Exhibit 115 shows that earnings tend to track nominal GDP growth closely over time, as corporations are paid in nominal dollars.",0
"As a result, it is very rare for earnings to decline when the economy is still expandinga fact that repeatedly confounded bearish calls for a collapse in earnings last year.",0
Our expectations for a slower pace of US dollar appreciation in 2023 could also help ease some of last years pressure on corporate revenues.,0
"At the same time, we do not consider rising interest expense a key concern this year, as more than Exhibit 113: Economists Probability of a US Recession in the Next 12 Months There is an unusual consensus among economists that a recession is likely.",0

" 70 Goldman Sachs january 2023 90% of S&P 500 firms debt is fixed, its average duration is long (at about 12 years) and only 7% of it matures this year.",1
50 Interest expense must also be netted against the interest income now being earned on nearly $2 trillion of cash on corporate balance sheets.,0
We also draw comfort from the strong historical correlation between sales growth and profit margins.,0
"Past periods with positive sales growthwhich we also expect this yearsaw margins remain flat or expand about two-thirds of the time, even during the inflationary 1970s (see Exhibit 116).",0
"Moreover, the significant improvement in global supply chains in recent quarters should help ease the pressure on profit margins this year (see Exhibit 117).",0
"Consistent with this analysis, our base case assumes relatively flat margins.",0
"If the economy instead enters a recession, earnings will likely decline from their 2022 level.",0
But whether that results in lower or higher stock prices at the end of 2023 depends critically on when the recession ends.,0
"As a rule, the market has more time to recover the earlier in the year a recession occurs.",0
Two factors explain this dynamic.,1
"First, stocks are forward-looking, meaning they typically fall in anticipation of a deteriorating economic environment but begin recovering even as earnings are still being downgraded.",0
"During past bear markets, equities have typically troughed six to nine months before earnings reach their low (see Exhibit 118).",0
Equities have also typically bottomed about three months before the end of recessions.,0
"Put simply, markets bottom when the news is still bad.",0
"Second, the recovery from past recessionary lows has been rapid, with the S&P 500 rallying about 20% over the span of a few months (see Exhibit 119).",0
The combination of these two factors suggests that even a recession ending late this year would still be consistent with our base case S&P Exhibit 116: Percentage of Time Profit Margins Expanded When S&P 500 Sales Grew Periods with positive sales growth saw margins remain flat or expand about two-thirds of the time.,0

"Because not all paths in a recession lead to lower equity prices at the end of this year, we believe the odds of positive equity returns exceed those of a recession in 2023.",0
Other factors also support this conclusion.,1
Once the market has fallen into bear-market territorywhich happened last year around 3800 on the S&P 500the median equity gain in the following year was 23% (see Exhibit 121).,0
"Similarly, history suggests 83% odds of a gain in 2023 given the rarity of two consecutive down years for the S&P 500.",0
"This year is also the third in the presidential cycle, which has historically had the highest returns of the four-year cycle and 84% odds of a gain (see Exhibit 122).",0
It is also worth mentioning that past years that saw a similarly large decline in the S&P 500 P/E ratio have typically been followed by strong equity returns (see Exhibit 123).,0
"While some have attributed last years P/E de-rating to higher real interest rates alone, we think it also reflects genuine recessionary concerns.",0
"That connection is apparent in Exhibit 124, which shows that real interest rates and Bloomberg stories about recession rose in tandem last year in response to the Federal Reserves aggressive rate hiking cycle.",0
"In fact, 2022 featured as many Bloomberg stories on recession as 2020, a year when the US economy was actually in recession.",0

Non-US Developed Market Equities: A Rocky Road to Recovery The relative performance of non-US developed equities was a bright spot last year.,0
"As seen in Exhibit 131, the 7% decline in the MSCI EAFE (Europe, Australasia, and the Far East) index in local currency terms significantly outperformed the declines seen in both US and emerging market stocks, which were closer to 20%.",0
"Some developed equity markets, such as the UK and Australia, even finished 2022 with gains.",0
"Although we expect more uniformly positive equity returns across EAFE countries in 2023, the path is unlikely to be smooth.",0
"This year likely begins with recessions in two of the largest developed equity markets outside the US, the Eurozone and the UK, which together represent around half of EAFE market capitalization.",0
"At the same time, ongoing geopolitical uncertainty in many countries likely sets a practical limit on how much of last years equity decline can be recouped.",0
"Despite these headwinds, we think forward- looking investors will push valuation multiples higher this year as they anticipate an eventual recovery in earnings.",0
"For EAFE, that implies a low-double-digit total return in local currency terms.",0
"We also forecast positive gains for European markets this year, but we expect only the UK to recapture its previous peak.",0
"Eurozone Equities: Continued Resilience Eurozone equities bested their global peers last year (see Exhibit 131), a notable departure from their tendency to lag in down markets.",0

"This resilience is likely to give way to lower earnings in 2023, as Europe begins the year in a recession amid a global growth slowdown.",0
"Even so, we expect investors to push P/E ratios higher as the region emerges from a short-lived and relatively shallow economic downturn this year, just as they have during prior recessions (see Exhibit 132).",0
That view is supported by the areas relatively attractive valuations.,0
"At just 11.3x, the Eurozones P/E ratio stands in the bottom 30% of the post-GFC distribution and below its pre- pandemic value.",0
The net result of falling earnings amid rising valuations should be a low-double- digit total return for Eurozone equities this year; many elements of our forecast are the mirror image of their values last year (see Exhibit 133).,0
"As discussed in Section I, we remain overweight the Eurozone banks.",0
"Not only did the sector outperform broader Eurozone equities once again last year, but it also generated a positive return despite a global bear market.",0
Several factors underpin this resilience.,0
"First, the ongoing increase in global interest rates directly benefits the banks net interest income.",0
"Second, the banks have spent the last decade improving their balance sheets, resulting in higher capital ratios and fewer losses in their loan books.",0
"Finally, the sector is attractively valued, particularly relative to what investors have historically paid for the level of profitability it currently has.",0
"Against this backdrop, we continue to recommend an overweight to Eurozone banks given their improving profitability, scope for higher valuations and attractive 6% dividend yield.",0
UK Equities: Still Playing Catchup The gain in UK equities last year in local currency terms stood in sharp contrast to the significant losses seen in almost all other major equity markets.,0

"Yet despite last years strength, UK equities have still not closed the performance gap that emerged relative to other global equities after the start of the pandemic (see Exhibit 134).",0
"That gap is likely to extend into 2023, as UK earnings decline in response to a domestic recession and slowing global growth, as well as a waning tailwind from commodity prices and past sterling depreciation.",0
"But as was the case in the Eurozone, we expect investors willingness to pay higher valuations as the UK economy exits its recession to fully offset the decline in profits this year (see Exhibit 135).",0
The combination of declining profits and a modestly higher P/E ratioalong with the FTSE 100s 3.9% dividend yieldsupports a low-double- digit total return in our base case (see Exhibit 111).,0
"The currently depressed levels of investor sentiment also imply similar total returns to our baseline forecast in 2023, as this has been a contrarian indicator of future equity returns in the past.",0
Japanese Equities: Encore Unlikely Japan also outperformed global equities last year.,0
Three main factors drove this achievement.,0
"First, Japans overseas earnings benefited from the limited rise in the countrys interest rates and the sharp depreciation in its currency, both the result of the BOJs unwillingness to follow other central banks in tightening policy.",0
"Second, the Japanese economy was able to sustain above-trend growth.",0
"Lastly, the underweight position of foreign investors at the start of last year left little for them to sell (see Exhibit 136).",0
"Because these investors are typically the marginal buyers or sellers of Japanese equities, their underweight positioning indirectly supported the stocks.",0

"In fact, a more rapid or forceful tightening of monetary policy represents a key downside risk to our forecast.",0
"Given this balance of risks, an encore of last years outperformance is unlikely.",0
Emerging Market Equities: Fading Headwinds from the North Emerging market equities had another challenging year in 2022.,0
Their 20% decline capped the sixth year of lossesand eighth year of underperformance relative to the S&P 500in the last decade.,0
"While 16 of the 24 countries in the MSCI THEM Index had negative returns in 2022, North Asia was the largest headwind to the indexs performance (see Exhibit 137).",0
"Indeed, China, Korea and Taiwanwhich together account for 58% of MSCI THEM market capitalization collectively lost 25% last year, more than twice the 11% decline for the rest of the index.",0
We expect calmer winds from North Asia in 2023.,0
"Not only will conditions look more favorable with Chinas reopening, but the region should also benefit from abating declines in chip prices, less regulatory pressure on Chinas internet sector and less of a drag on profit margins from spiraling commodities prices.",0
"As a result, we expect MSCI THEM forward earnings to rise by 10% in 2023, to $90 per share.",0
"At the same time, valuation multiples should decline modestly to 11.4x, as slightly lower interest rates are offset by a moderate increase in the equity risk premium.",0
"Combined with THEM equities 3% dividend yield, these elements imply a high- single-digit total return in 2023 (see Exhibit 111).",0
"Despite these projected equity gains, we still see four dark clouds on the horizon.",0
"First, the outlook for China remains foggy given its rising economic, social and geopolitical risks, discussed in greater detail in our December 2022 Insight report, Middle Kingdom: Middle Income .",0
"Second, slower global growth will weigh heavily on export-dependent North Asia.",0
"Third, outflows from global investors could gain speed due to THEM equities continued underperformance.",0
"Finally, tightening in monetary policy last yearwhich saw the median policy rate among the 17 countries in the MSCI THEM Index with inflation-targeting central banks increase from 3% to 7% 51 after 101 collective rate hikeswas dramatic, and its ultimate impact remains highly uncertain.",0
"Although the gale-force headwinds of last year are likely to subside, we still expect some gusts ahead.",0

"Several factors underpinned this outperformance, including the most aggressive Federal Reserve hiking cycle in decades, along with a global energy shock and flagging risk sentiment that prompted investors to turn to the dollar as a safe haven.",0
The yen endured the worst of the US dollars strength and stood out as the worst-performing currency among developed market peers after the Swedish krona.,0
Surging import prices and an exceptionally accommodative Bank of Japan sent the yen 12% lower versus the dollar.,0

The dollars outperformance against every other developed market currency last year was yet another reminder of its hegemony.,0
"Although the dollar index recently traded at its highest level in 20 years, we think several factors continue to support dollar outperformance.",0

Such a development would help narrow Japans cross-border interest rate differential and reduce a recent source of yen weakness.,0
Also consider that the yen has historically performed well during economic slowdowns.,0
"While a US recession is not our base case, the possibility has risen markedly over the past year.",0
"Any additional global growth headwinds that boost risk aversion could lead investors into the yen as a liquid hedge, as we saw after the onset of previous recessions (see Exhibit 143).",0
"Of course, the yen also still faces several obstacles.",0
Japans current account surplus has halved over the last year given higher import prices.,0
"In turn, the trade balance shows its largest deficit ever (see Exhibit 144).",0
This implies marginally less structural demand for the yen and may limit its ability to recover to pre-pandemic levels.,0
"Japanese corporations are also likely to generate sustained pressure on the currency, as they continue to sell yen to invest in foreign ventures with better long-term growth prospects and higher yields.",0
"Although these outflows slowed during the initial stages of the pandemic, they have quickened more recently and now stand at about 3.5% of GDP, a historically large share.",0
"Taking these factors together, we see scope for a mid-single-digit rise in the yen, with the possibility of both long and short tactical trading opportunities throughout 2023.",0
"Pound Along with most other currencies in 2022, the pound fell in relation to the US dollarits second consecutive year of underperformance.",0
Last years 11% loss masked a more dramatic 25% peak- to-trough drawdown in the currency through September following a budget crisis and the resignation of two prime ministers.,0
"This continued the currencys volatile return profile, which dates back to 2016 and the United Kingdoms decision to leave the European Union.",0
We expect further weakness in the pound in 2023.,0
"The UK economy is forecast to contract this year, which may limit how much further the Bank of England can tighten and opens the door for rate cuts in late 2023 or 2024.",0
A less favorable absolute policy rate differential with the US could also diminish the appeal of the pound to yield- seeking investors.,0
"Moreover, the UKs position as a net energy importer has pushed its current account deficit to 4.2% of GDP (see Exhibit 145).",0
This too will be a drag on the pound unless the energy shock recedes rapidly.,0
"Still, the risks to the pound are not completely to the downside.",0
"Any combination of better global growth or optimism for a faster-than-expected UK economic recovery could generate foreign demand for UK assets, which would benefit the pound.",0

"Higher energy prices were particularly hard on European emerging market currencies, which depreciated 1025% into last fall.",0
"The hostilities were also accompanied by a fast-paced hiking cycle in the US and a broad- based selloff in risk assets, leading to tighter global financial conditions that weighed on THEM currencies.",0

 83 Outlook Investment Strategy Group Global Fixed Income Outlook Most bond investors will be glad to turn the page on 2022.,1
A combination of aggressive interest rate hikes by global central banks and historically low bond yields at the start of the year resulted in deep losses for fixed income portfolios last year.,0
"The Bloomberg Global Aggregate Bond Index fell 16%, a decline three times larger than the previous worst reading since the benchmarks inception in 1990.",0
While credit fared better than durationwith spreads supported by robust nominal growthall fixed income categories suffered losses last year (see Exhibit 148).,0
"Fortunately for bondholders, an encore is unlikely for several reasons.",0
The higher starting level of todays yields provides bond investors with a buffer to absorb any further increases in interest rates.,0
"Moreover, the upward pressure on rates from central bank hikes should ease given our expectation that the Federal Reserve will conclude its tightening cycle in the first half of 2023, and that the ECB and BOE will do the same shortly thereafter.",0
"Lastly, our forecast of below- trend growth implies easing inflationary pressures and higher risk of recession, both of which increase the odds of eventual Federal Reserve rate cuts.",0
"Against this backdrop, we expect lower 10-year yields across most advanced and emerging economies this year.",0
"Of course, our constructive view on bonds does not imply the absence of risks.",1
"Across the US, Eurozone and United Kingdom, private markets will need to absorb a record $3 trillion in estimated net bond supply this year (see Exhibit 149), composed of around $2 trillion in net new sovereign debt and $1 trillion fewer bond purchases by central banks (i.e., quantitative tightening).",0
"With central banks withdrawing the largest source of demand in recent years, there is risk that private investors will require higher risk premiums to accommodate the elevated funding needs of advanced economies.",0

"Still, we think the balance of risks supports positive total returns for intermediate fixed income in our base case (see Exhibit 150).",0

"In contrast, high- quality fixed income is the only asset that has effectively hedged against past deflationary shocks.",0
"In the sections that follow, we will review the specifics of each major fixed income market.",1
US Treasuries Our 2022 Outlook featured the most negative expected returns for US Treasuries that we have ever published.,0
Yet the actual losses last year exceeded even our pessimistic forecasts.,0
"In the case of the 10-year Treasury, investors were left with a historic 16% loss after its yield registered the largest increase in a calendar year on record.",0
"The prospects for 10-year Treasuries are brighter now, with the midpoint of our year-end 3.153.65% yield target range implying positive high-single-digit returns in 2023.",0
"We expect the Federal Reserve to conclude its hiking cycle before the middle of the year, as its focus shifts from curtailing inflation to avoiding a hard landing of the economy.",0
The combination of still-restrictive policy rates and the markets expectation of eventual rate cuts in response to slowing growth is likely to keep the yield curve inverted.,0
Investors are focused on when policy rates and bond yields will peak.,0
"While history is not a perfect guide, it does show that in nearly every hiking cycle over the last 40 years, the 10-year Treasury yield reached its high before or around the time when policy rates peaked.",0
Only twicein May 1974 and December 1980did the 10-year yield peak after the policy rate did.,0
Both exceptions occurred in a decade of stop-go monetary policy shifts that ultimately allowed inflation expectations to become unanchored.,0
"Yet in contrast with that period, market-based inflation expectations now remain well anchored following the fastest hiking cycle in decades.",0
History suggests that 10-year yields could peak before or around the second quarter of this year as the Federal Reserve concludes its hiking cycle.,0
"In fact, yields may have already peaked last year.",0
"Prior peaks in the policy rate have been followed by large declines in 10-year yields over the subsequent year, ranging from 80 basis points to 330 basis points.",0
"The 3.4% midpoint of our forecast range implies a more gradual decline in yields than is suggested by history, but we anticipate this slower decline for three reasons.",0
"First, positive economic growth in our base case should support yields.",0
"Second, we expect inflation to moderate but remain above the Federal Reserves target this year.",0
"Finally, the bond market will have to absorb around $2 trillion of net Treasury supply this yearup from $1.6 trillion in 2022as US funding needs remain elevated at a time when the Federal Reserve is winding down its balance sheet.",0

"In nearly every hiking cycle over the last 40 years, the 10-year Treasury yield reached its high before or around the time when policy rates peaked.",0
 85 Outlook Investment Strategy Group Treasuries are sufficiently compelling given similar returns from cash and lingering inflation uncertainty.,0
"We believe so, since unexpected rate cuts by the Federal Reserve in response to a growth shock could quickly erode the yield on cash.",0
"At the same time, such a scenario could see 10-year Treasuries deliver double-digit total returns, roughly four times larger than those of cash (see Exhibit 151).",0
"As we often highlight, Treasuries are the only asset class that has effectively hedged against deflationary shocks in the past.",0
"Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) After the fastest Federal Reserve hiking cycle in four decades, market-based inflation expectations fell sharply from their highs last year and remain well anchored near the banks 2% inflation target (see Exhibit 152).",0
Rising nominal interest rates coupled with lower inflation expectations drove 10-year real rates higher by a staggering 268 basis points.,0
The resulting 12% loss in TIPS last year underperformed similar-duration nominal bonds despite the sharpest increase in inflation since the 1980s.,0
We think the outlook for TIPS is brighter in 2023.,0
"With 10-year breakeven inflation rates already near the Federal Reserves 2% inflation target, the scope for further declines is more limited.",0
"Moreover, TIPS should benefit from some retracement in real rates after last years surge, as we expect stable inflation breakeven rates and declining nominal 10-year Treasury yields.",0
"Still, TIPS investors face several familiar headwinds.",0
"For one, TIPS lack the hedging qualities of traditional bonds since breakeven inflation rates tend to fall during cyclical downturns.",0
TIPS are also less liquid than nominal Treasuries and hence an inferior source of liquidity during market turbulence.,0
"54 Additionally, TIPS are not tax efficient for taxable clients.",1
"For all these reasons, we continue to advise US clients with taxable accounts to use municipal bonds for their strategic allocation.",0
US Municipal Bonds There was little to celebrate for municipal bond investors last year.,0
"The Bloomberg Municipal Bond Index fell 8.5%, its worst decline since 1982.",0
"Similarly, the 4.8% loss in the shorter duration 1- to 10-year municipal bond index was its worst performance since the inception of the index in 1993.",0
"Municipal high yield bonds were not spared either, losing 13.1% for the year (see Exhibit 153).",0
Several factors contributed to this poor performance.,0
Chief among these was the nearly Exhibit 151: ISG Prospective 2023 US Fixed Income Scenarios The distribution of risks for intermediate Treasuries has become attractive.,0

 86 Goldman Sachs january 2023 250 basis point increase in the yield on the broader municipal bond index last year.,0
"This drag was made worse by the historically low level of municipal bond yields and spreads at the start of 2022, which provided little buffer to absorb higher rates.",0
The largest exodus from the asset class since 1984 was also a material headwind to performance.,0
"As seen in Exhibit 154, municipal bonds registered $118 billion of outflows from mutual funds and ETFs in 2022, around twice the amount seen during the 2013 taper tantrum. Last years poor performance stands in contrast to municipal fundamentals, which remain healthy.",0
"General fund revenue for states grew 14.5% year- over-year to $1.17 trillion in fiscal 2022, following a 16.6% increase in fiscal 2021.",0
"Although spending rose by 18.3% year-over-year in response to a variety of factors, including higher inflation and lingering pandemic costs, no state made a budget cut due to a revenue shortfall last year.",0
"As shown in Exhibit 155, the states general fund rainy day balances grew to an all-time high of $134.5 billion in 2022, with the median balance as a share of annual spending also reaching an all-time high of 11.6%.",0
"55 Looking ahead, we expect mid-single-digit nominal consumption growth in 2023 to underpin healthy sales tax collections.",0
"Moreover, our expectation for only a modest rise in the unemployment rate to 4.1% implies that personal income tax revenues should remain resilient.",0

"Moreover, only 1.4% of these bonds trade at distressed spreads, well below the 7.9% average since 2008 (see Exhibit 163).",0

The result was that only 3.7% of high yields total 11.2% loss was attributable to wider spreads and actual default losses.,0
"Similarly, the corporate high yield credit default swap indexwhich reflects just the default risk of the underlying bondssuffered a loss of less than 1% last year (see Exhibit 153 in the US Municipal Bond section).",0
Healthy corporate fundamentals help explain why high yield bond spreads have remained so well-behaved.,0
"As seen in Exhibit 167, median leverage among high yield issuers has been lower only 11% of the time since 1999.",0
"At the same time, the earnings of the median issuer are four times larger than their interest expense, close to the highest coverage ratios on record.",0
These figures are equally sturdy for leveraged loan borrowers (see Exhibit 168).,0
"The underlying credit quality of the high yield universe has also improved, with BB-rated bonds representing nearly half the index today compared to about a third of it historically.",0
"Similarly, the share of bonds rated CCC and lowerwhich are at higher risk of defaultstands below its historical average.",0
Issuance by these lower-rated companies is also still low relative to history (see Exhibit 169).,0
"The same could be said for the share of LBO and M&A-related issuance, which is below its pre-GFC average.",0
"Consistent with this backdrop, credit rating agency upgrades of high yield bonds outpaced downgrades by 1.8 times last year based on dollar par value, and recovery rates on defaulted securities were well above average.",0
Whether fundamentals remain resilient in the face of slower economic growth this year is a critical question facing investors.,0

" 92 Goldman Sachs january 2023 Still, rising defaults should not be equated to soaring ones.",0
"The default rate ended last year in the bottom 15% of its historical distribution, making some increase in 2023 very likely.",0
"In addition, the risk of refinancing-related defaults is low in the next two years, with less than 10% of the securities in the high yield market maturing (see Exhibit 173).",0
Higher interest rates are also likely to continue constraining high yield bond issuance after it decreased by more than 60% last year.,0
"Against this backdrop, our model implies a 3% par-weighted default rate for high yield bonds this year, roughly in line with their long-term average (see Exhibit 174).",0
"The rate is a slightly higher 3.5% for leveraged loans, given the idiosyncratic factors discussed earlier.",0
"With default rates normalizing higher, we expect high yield spreads will widen to around 550 basis points.",0
Such a spread would be sufficient to offer investors an incremental risk premium above expected default losses consistent with the historical average (see Exhibit 175).,0
"Given the current level of spreadsincluding higher spreads for leveraged loans, which have a weaker credit profileour forecasts imply mid-single-digit total returns for both high yield bonds and bank loans this year.",0
"European Bonds As energy shocks roiled the continent and inflation climbed to 40-year highs, European policymakers faced an uncomfortable trade-off: sacrifice economic growth by confronting inflation through tighter monetary policy or dampen the energy shock by instituting fiscal stimulus that risked pushing prices even higher.",0
"UK policymakers decided to try both at once, upsetting an already fragile European bond complex.",0
"Fortunately, subsequent BOE intervention and a tighter fiscal budget in the UK ultimately prevented broader contagion and stabilized European bond markets.",0
"Even so, yields rose sharply in 2022 and European bonds fell nearly 20%, underperforming US Treasuries.",0
Europe faces the same uncomfortable trade- off in 2023.,0
"With inflation pressures still elevated, energy supply impaired and the region likely in recession, policymakers must tread carefully.",0
"Our base case calls for the ECB and BOE to extend their hiking cycles to a range of 3.253.75% and 4.254.75%, respectively.",0
Restrictive monetary policycombined with the hit to disposable income from higher energy pricesis likely to weigh on growth significantly.,0
"Put simply, the longer rates stay in restrictive territory, the greater the odds the market will price in a deeper-cutting cycle by the end of this year.",0
We therefore expect German and UK 10-year yields will respectively stand about 150 basis points and 125 basis points below their policy rate by year-end.,0
"While the outlook for their prices is improving, our enthusiasm for European bonds is tempered by the elevated volatility that we expect.",0

"Additionally, weaker economic activity may test central bankers resolve and lead to more opaque forward guidance.",0
"Furthermore, both the ECB and BOE are attempting to reduce their balance sheets at a time when government issuance remains elevated, forcing the private sector to absorb record net supply in 2023 (see Exhibit 176).",0
Our expectation that the ECB will extend its hiking cyclea remarkable feat following nearly a decade of negative policy ratescomes with another unique challenge.,0
The heterogeneous nature of the currency bloc means ECB policy impacts countries differently.,0
Consider that real rates in Italy stand more than two percentage points above those in Germany despite substantially lower potential growth.,0
"Higher funding costs in the economies least able to bear them are likely to ignite concerns around debt sustainability, putting pressure on peripheral spreads.",0
"Against this backdrop, and despite expecting German 10-year yields to fall toward our 1.752.25% forecast range, we recommend a neutral stance to peripheral bonds.",0
The BOE also faces several hurdles.,0
"First, the policy debacle last September remains fresh in investors minds, meaning tolerance for negative surprises will be more limited and the risk premium priced into the bonds by investors more persistent.",0
"Second, the nature of the UK mortgage market results in rapid transmission of monetary policy.",0
"With around half the stock of mortgages repricing this year to much higher rates, many households will see their monthly mortgage payments double, denting disposable income.",0
"56 Third, net supply of gilts the private sector must absorb is estimated to quadruple to £260 billion.",0

Emerging Market Dollar Debt Emerging market dollar debt (EMD) was held hostage by higher US Treasury yields in 2022.,0
"As seen in Exhibit 178, EMDs 18% loss last year represented the worst annual return since its inception in 1993.",0
"The bulk of this loss resulted from the sharp increase in US Treasury yields, as EMD spreads ended the year around their 10-year average, despite significant widening in countries such as Pakistan and Sri Lanka (see Exhibit 179).",0
"As the market shifts its focus from high inflation to slower growth in 2023, we believe that spreads are likely to face more pressure than they did last year.",0
"History corroborates this view, as EMD spreads have typically widened by 250 basis points during mild recessions and 650 basis points during deeper global downturns.",0
"Even so, the drag from wider spreads this year should be more than offset by EMDs yield and the benefit from its longer, nearly seven-year duration given the lower US Treasury yields we expect.",0

"But this impressive gain belied a more nuanced reality, as returns reached 54% by early June, only to be halved in the second half of the year.",0
Investors also faced a wide dispersion among individual commodities and their source of returns.,0
"In contrast to the indexs overall strength, both industrial metals and precious metals suffered losses last year.",0
"And while the energy subindex outperformed with a 39% gain, the bulk of this came from positive carry, or the additional return holders of a commodity get when the futures curve is strongly downward sloping, called backwardation. The appreciation in spot energy prices was a much smaller 14%.",0
The disjointed nature of these returns reflects the tug-of-war between bullish supply-side pressures and bearish demand-side concerns that is likely to continue in the year ahead.,0
"Although years of underinvestment are an underlying support for many commodity prices, a deeper global economic slowdown could quickly undermine demand, especially given the still-uncertain trajectory of Chinas economy amid its shifting COVID policies.",0
"Against these risks, we note that global inventories have remained low across most commodities despite months of weak Chinese demanda sign of equally weak supply trends.",0
"A thinner inventory buffer also leaves prices sensitive to potential supply disruptions in politically unstable areas, such as South America for base metals, ordiscussed further belowRussia and the Middle East for oil.",0
"Given these crosscurrents, we believe that risks around our base case are roughly balanced for industrial metals and oil prices this year.",0
"As for gold, we remain doubtful about its ability to provide investors with a reliable hedge against inflation or political risk given its notable failure to do so in the past year.",0
"Oil: High Risks, Low Inventories Oil prices last year were driven by geopolitical developments to a degree not seen since the turbulent 1970s.",0
"As seen in Exhibit 181, close to 10% of global oil production found itself at risk of disruption virtually overnight in the wake of Russias invasion of Ukraine and the ensuing rollout of Western sanctions.",0
"Given already low global oil inventories and thin spare capacity, oil prices understandably spiked higher, reaching $124 at their peak closing level last March.",0
Prices have since fallen back below pre-war levels.,0
"This surprising retracement reflects not only the failure of supply risks to materialize, but also a combination of bearish developments, including an unprecedented 200-million-barrel release from the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve, a COVID- driven slump in Chinese oil demand and fears of an impending recession.",0

The full effect of European sanctions on Russia will not be visible in energy markets until the first quarter of this year.,0
These curbs directly impact 0.5 million b/d of seaborne crude oil and 1.1 million b/d of refined products.,0
"While Russia has so far been successful at redirecting crude exports to India and China, this strategy is starting to show some limits (see Exhibit 182).",0
"Moreover, it will be difficult for Russia to replicate this strategy in refined products, as both China and India were net exporters in this category last year.",0
"As a result, close to 2 million b/d of Russian supplies to Europe remain at risk.",0
"Consensus currently expects a net loss of less than half that amount, increasing the risk of an upside surprise.",0
"Upward pressure on energy prices could also arise from supply disruptions in other countries, given geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and domestic instability in Libya and other exporting countries.",0
"To be sure, the demand for oil faces an equally high degree of risk amid a potential US recession and the still-uncertain trajectory of Chinas economy.",0
"We estimate that Chinese demand fell by 0.5 million b/d on average last year, marking the first annual decline since 1990 (see Exhibit 183).",0
"While a successful reopening of Chinas economy could help offset weaker oil demand elsewhere, a more protracted COVID wave could exacerbate demand concerns.",0
"For now, we expect global demand to remain on an upward trajectory in our base case, exceeding pre- COVID levels by year-end.",0
"Meeting this demand will require continuing growth from US producers, as OPEC has already ramped its output back to pre-COVID levels and has limited spare capacity.",0
"But to incentivize additional drilling, oil prices must remain high enough to overcome the cost inflation and self- imposed capital discipline now holding back US production.",0
"In contrast, lower prices and disappointing demand would likely restrain production growth.",0
"Tellingly, the November and December oil price slump was rapidly followed by a decline in US drilling and completion activity, while OPEC immediately announced a production cut to rescue prices.",0
"Given these moving pieces, we expect WTI prices to trade in a $70100 range by year-end, which would imply upside from current levels.",0
"But we are mindful of the many risks that could undermine this forecastincluding a US recession, another wave of global COVID infections or a quick resolution to the conflict in Ukraineany one of which could push prices down to cost support near $60.",0
"That said, we would not expect these lower prices to be sustained for an extended period, given producers likely reaction.",0

"Ayco may, separately and distinctly from GSFO Services, provide tax and insurance advice in addition to personal family office services (Ayco Family Office Services).",1
We encourage you to clearly establish your set of services with your advisory team.,1
Investment Strategy Group (ISG).,1
"The Investment Strategy Group, part of the Asset & Wealth Management business (AWM) of GS, focuses on asset allocation strategy formation and market analysis for GS Wealth Management.",1
"Any information that references ISG, including their model portfolios, represents the views of ISG, is not financial research and is not a product of GS Global Investment Research and may vary significantly from views expressed by individual portfolio management teams within AWM, or other groups at GS.",1
ISG Model Portfolios are provided for illustrative purposes only.,1
Your actual asset allocation may look significantly different based on your particular circumstances and risk tolerance.,1
Model performance calculations assume that (1) each asset class was owned in accordance with the recommended weight; (2) all tactical tilts were tracked at the time the recommendation was made; and (3) the portfolios are rebalanced at the end of every quarter.,1
Model performance is calculated using the daily returns (actual or interpolated) of indices that ISG believes are representative of the asset classes included in the model.,1
"Results shown reflect the total return but generally do not consider any investment management fees, commissions or other transaction expenses, which would reduce returns.",1
Hedge fund indices and data from Cambridge Associates are net of manager fees.,1
The results shown reflect the reinvestment of dividends and other earnings.,1
All returns are pre- tax and are not adjusted for inflation.,1
Additional information about the model portfolio performance calculations is available upon request.,1
Investment Risks and Information.,1
offers a range of products that you should carefully consider for their unique terms and risks prior to investing to ensure they are appropriate for your individual circumstances.,1
"Below are descriptions of major risks for our more complex products; please review the offering documents and product prospectuses for particular products, as well as additional information about the nature and risks of these and other products in GS&Co.s ADV Part 2A Brochure and PWM Relationship Guide.",1
Investing involves the risk of loss.,1
Alternative Investments (AI).,1
"AIs may involve a substantial degree of risk, including the risk of total loss of capital, use of leverage, lack of liquidity, and volatility of returns.",1
"Private equity, private credit, private real estate, hedge funds, and AI investments structured as private investment funds are subject to less regulation than other types of pooled vehicles.",1
"Review the Offering Memorandum, Subscription Agreement, and any other applicable offering documents for risks, potential conflicts of interest, terms and conditions and other disclosures.",1
"The risk of loss in trading commodities can be substantial due, but not limited, to lack of liquidity, volatile political, market, and economic conditions, and abrupt changes in price which may result from unpredictable factors including weather, labor strikes, inflation, foreign exchange rates, etc.",0
"Due to the use of leverage, a small move against your position may result in a loss that may be larger than your initial deposit.",0
"Currency exchange rates can be extremely volatile, particularly during times of political or economic uncertainty.",0
There is a risk of loss when an investor has exposure to foreign currency or holds foreign currency traded investments.,1
Digital Assets/Cryptocurrency.,1
Digital assets regulation is still developing across all jurisdictions and governments may in the future restrict the use and exchange of any or all digital assets.,1
"Digital assets are generally not backed nor supported by any government or central bank, are not FDIC insured and do not have the same protections that YOU.S. or other countries bank deposits may have and are more volatile than traditional currencies.",1
"Transacting in digital assets carries the risk of market manipulation and cybersecurity failures such as the risk of hacking, theft, programming bugs, and accidental loss.",1
Differing forms of digital assets may carry different risks.,1
The volatility and unpredictability of the price of digital assets may lead to significant and immediate losses.,0
Over-the-Counter (OTC) Derivatives.,1
OTC derivatives are illiquid as there is no public market.,1
The price or valuation of each OTC derivative transaction is individually negotiated between GS&Co.,1
"and each counterparty, and GS&Co.",1
does not represent or warrant that the prices for which it offers OTC derivative transactions are the best prices available.,1
You may therefore have trouble establishing whether the price you have been offered for a particular OTC derivative transaction is fair.,1
"OTC derivatives may trade at a value that is different from the level inferred from interest rates, dividends, and the underlier due to factors including expectations of future levels of interest rates and dividends, and the volatility of the underlier prior to maturity.",1
"The market price of the OTC derivative transaction may be influenced by many unpredictable factors, including economic conditions, GS creditworthiness, the value of any underliers, and certain actions taken by GS.",1
"Because GS may be obligated to make substantial payments to you as a condition of an OTC derivative transaction, you must evaluate the credit risk of doing business with GS.",1
"Depending on the type of transaction, your counterparty may be GS&Co.",1
or another GS affiliate.,1
Counterparties may be subject to different rules depending on whether they are a registered YOU.S. broker dealer.,1
OTC derivative transactions with GS affiliates cannot be assigned or transferred without GSs prior written consent.,1
"The provisions of an OTC derivative transaction may allow for early termination and, in such cases, either you or GS may be required to make a potentially significant termination payment depending upon whether the OTC derivative transaction is in-the-money at the time of termination.",1
"You should carefully review the Master Agreement, including any related schedules, credit",1
" support documents, addenda, and exhibits.",1
You may be requested to post margin or collateral at levels consistent with the internal policies of GS to support written OTC derivatives Emerging Markets and Growth Markets.,1
"Emerging markets and growth markets investments involve certain considerations, including political and economic conditions, the potential difficulty of repatriating funds or enforcing contractual or other legal rights, and the small size of the securities markets in such countries coupled with a low volume of trading, resulting in potential lack of liquidity and price volatility.",0
Non-US Securities.,1
"Non-US securities investments are subject to differing regulations, less public information, less liquidity, and greater volatility in the countries of domicile of the security issuers and/or the jurisdiction in which these securities are traded.",1
"In addition, investors in securities such as ADRs/ GDRs, whose values are influenced by foreign currencies, effectively assume currency risk.",0
The purchase of options can result in the loss of an entire investment and the risk of uncovered options is potentially unlimited.,1
You must read and understand the current Options Disclosure Document before entering into any options transactions.,1
The booklet entitled Characteristics and Risk of Standardized Options can be obtained from your PWM team or at docs/riskstoc.pdf.,1
A secondary market may not be available for all options.,1
"Transaction costs may be significant in option strategies that require multiple purchases and sales of options, such as spreads.",1
"Supporting documentation for any comparisons, recommendations, statistics, technical data, or other information will be supplied upon request.",1
Real Estate.,1
"Real estate investments, including real estate investments trusts (REITS) and non-traded REITS, involve additional risks not typically associated with other asset classes.",1
"Such investments (both through public and private markets) may be subject to changes in broader macroeconomic conditions, such as interest rates, and sensitivities to temporary or permanent reductions in property values for the geographic region(s) represented.",0
"Non-traded REITS may carry a higher risk of illiquidity, incomplete or nontransparent valuations, dilution of shares, and conflicts of interest.",0
Structured Investments.,1
Structured investments are complex and investors assume the credit risk of the issuer or guarantor.,1
"If the issuer or guarantor defaults, you may lose your entire investment, even if you hold the product to maturity.",1
Structured investments often perform differently from the asset(s) they reference.,1
Credit ratings may pertain to the credit rating of the issuer and are not indicative of the market risk associated with the structured investment or the reference asset.,1
"Each structured investment is different, and for each investment you should consider 1) the possibility that at expiration you may be forced to own the reference asset at a depressed price; 2) limits on the ability to share in upside appreciation; 3) the potential for increased losses if the reference asset declines; and 4) potential inability to sell given the lack of a public trading market.",0
Tactical Tilts.,1
Tactical tilts may involve a high degree of risk.,1
No assurance can be made that profits will be achieved or that substantial losses will not be incurred.,1
"For various reasons, GS may implement a tactical tilt, invest in an affiliated fund that may invest in tactical tilts, or unwind a position for its client advisory accounts or on its own behalf before your advisor does on behalf of your account, or may implement a tactical tilt that is different from the tactical tilt implemented by advisors on client accounts, which could have an adverse effect on your account and may result in poorer performance by your account than by GS or other client accounts.",1
Registered Mutual Funds / Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) or Exchange Traded Notes (ETNs).,1
"You should consider a funds investment objectives, risks, and costs, and read the summary prospectus and/or the Prospectus (which may be obtained from your PWM Team) carefully before investing.",1
You may obtain documents for ETFs or ETNs for free by 1) visiting EDGAR on the SEC website at http:// www.sec.gov/; 2) contacting your PWM Team; or 3) calling toll-free at 1-866-471-2526.,1
"Unlike traditional mutual funds, ETFs can trade at a discount or premium to the net asset value and are not directly redeemable by the fund.",1
"Leveraged or inverse ETFs, ETNs, or commodities futures-linked ETFs may experience greater price movements than traditional ETFs and may not be appropriate for all investors.",0
Most leveraged and inverse ETFs or ETNs seek to deliver multiples of the performance (or the inverse of the performance) of the underlying index or benchmark on a daily basis.,1
Their performance over a longer period of time can vary significantly from the stated daily performance objectives or the underlying benchmark or index due to the effects of compounding.,1
Performance differences may be magnified in a volatile market.,0
"Commodities futures-linked ETFs may perform differently than the spot price for the commodity itself, including due to the entering into and liquidating of futures or swap contracts on a continuous basis to maintain exposure (i.e., rolling) and disparities between near term future prices and long term future prices for the underlying commodity.",0
You should not assume that a commodity-futures linked ETF will provide an effective hedge against other risks in your portfolio.,0
Security-Specific References.,1
References to a specific company or security are intended solely as examples or for context and are not research or investment advice; do not rely upon them in making an investment decision.,1
GS may have a relationship with such companies and/or its securities that may present conflicts of interest.,1
Contact your PWM Team for further information on any securities mentioned.,1
Off-Platform Investments.,1
"If you ask us for guidance on external investment opportunities not offered by GS, any information we may provide is as an accommodation only and we will not be acting as your advisor.",1

Our Form ADV has information on conflicts of interest we may have in connection with any such requests.,1

"Forecasts and any return expectations are as of the date of this material, and do not project returns of any given investment or strategy.",1

Any case studies and examples are for illustrative purposes only.,1
"If applicable, a copy of the GIR Report used for GIR forecasts is available upon request.",1
"Forecasts do not reflect advisory fees, transaction costs, and other expenses a client would have paid, which would reduce return.",1
Client Specific Markets.,1
Investments held in your name with a subcustodian in the local market where traded in order to comply with local law will be indicated on your statements.,1
Performance / Estimated Income / Estimated Cash Flow.,1
Past performance is not a guide of future results and may include investments no longer owned in current or closed accounts.,1
Current performance may be lower or higher than the performance data quoted.,0
"Where not relevant or representative, outliers may be excluded.",1
"To request the most current or historical performance data, or asset classification schema information, please contact your PWM team at the number provided on your monthly statement or toll-free in the YOU.S. at 1-800-323-5678.",1
"Performance reports, where shown, generally present the relevant time weighted performance, which is a combination of daily returns compounded over a specified time period with the removal of the deposit and withdrawal impacts, and may show internal rate of return calculations where requested.",1
Aggregate performance may not equal the sum of returns at an investment level.,1
"Where performance is shown net of fees, actual fees may differ.",1
"Net performance for advisory accounts is calculated net of fees and expenses that were or would have been paid in connection with GSs services, including management fees, and might include investments for which actual market prices are not currently available.",1
"If included, estimated income figures and estimated private equity future cash flows are estimates of future activity, and actual results may vary substantially.",1
has adjusted performance calculations for certain asset classes or strategies and may do so in the future.,1
"Performance of net cash (i.e., cash less margin debit) is generally included in the total performance calculation but not displayed separately.",1
Option performance is included in the performance of the asset class of the underlier.,1
Offer to Provide Additional Performance Information.,1
"Where GS provides you with the results of a subset of investments extracted from a portfolio (extracted performance), you may request the performance results of the total portfolio.",1
"Where GS provides you with illustrative performance regarding private fund investments that was not actually achieved by GS (hypothetical performance), you may request additional information regarding the risks and limitations of using such performance.",1
Indices/Benchmarks.,1
"References to indices, benchmarks, or other measures of relative market performance over a specified period are informational only and are not predictions or guarantees of performance.",1
"In addition to the benchmark assigned to a specific investment strategy, other benchmarks (Comparative Benchmarks) may be displayed, including ones displayed at your request.",1
Managers may not review the performance of your,1
 account against the performance of Comparative Benchmarks.,1
"Where a benchmark for a strategy has changed, the historical benchmark(s) are available upon request.",1
Inception to date (IT WOULD) returns and benchmark/ reference portfolio returns may reflect different periods.,1
IT WOULD returns for accounts or asset classes only reflect performance during periods in which your account(s) held assets and/ or were invested in the asset class.,1
The benchmark or reference portfolio returns shown reflect the benchmark / portfolio performance from the date of inception of your account or your initial investment in the asset class.,1
"If displayed, estimated income figures are estimates of future activity obtained from third party sources.",1
Indices are unmanaged and investors cannot directly invest in them.,1
"The figures for the index reflect the reinvestment of all income or dividends, as applicable, but may not always reflect the deduction of any fees or expenses which would reduce returns.",1
"Where appropriate, relevant index trademarks or index information has been licensed or sub-licensed for use.",1
"Inclusion of index information does not mean the relevant index or its affiliated entities sponsor, endorse, sell, or promote the referenced securities, or that they make any representation or warranty regarding either the advisability of investing in securities or the ability of the index to track market performance.",1
Pricing and Valuations.,1
"Prices do not necessarily reflect realizable values and are based on information considered to be reliable but are not guaranteed for accuracy, currency, or as realizable values.",1
Certain positions may be provided by third parties or may appear without a price if GS is unable to obtain a price and/or the security is not actively traded for a certain amount of time.,1
Pricing sources and methods are available upon request and are subject to change.,1
Consolidated Reporting and Third Party Investments.,1
"Where GS provides a consolidated report or references information regarding your non-GS investments held by third party custodians, such information provided as a courtesy for informational purposes only; it is not your official statement.",1
Such information (including valuof any materials/information provided to us.,1
"GS does not perform review or diligence on, independently verify the accuracy of information regarding, or provide advice on such non-GS investments; GS assumes no responsibility for the accuracy of the source information and such assets may not be included on GSs books and records.",1
