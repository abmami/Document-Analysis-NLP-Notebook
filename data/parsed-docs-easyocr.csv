Certain high-volatility investments can be subject to sudden and large falls in value that could equal the amount invested: Important Disclosure on High Yield Bonds Unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities typically offer a higher yield than investment grade Debt Securities, but also present greater risks with respect to liquidity, volatility , and non-payment of principal and interest: As a result of being classified as non investment grade Debt Securities, these Debt Securities present a greater degree of credit risk relative to many other fixed income Debt Securities_ Higher Credit Risk Unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities generally have predominantly speculative characteristics with respect to the issuer's capacity to pay interest and repay principal_ There is greater risk of non-payment of interest and loss of principal. Many issuers of these Debt Securities have experienced substantial difficulties in servicing their debt obligations, which has led to default and restructurings. The issuers of these Debt Securities generally have to pay a higher rate of interest than investment grade Debt Securities. Higher Liquidity and Secondary Market Risk _ The markets in which unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities are traded are generally more limited than those in which investment grade Debt Securities are traded: This lack of liquidity may make it more difficult to resell these Debt Securities and obtain market quotations Downgrade Risk Downgrades in the credit rating of unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities by rating agencies are generally accompanied by declines in the market value of these Debt Securities. In some circumstances, investors in the unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities market may anticipate such downgrades as a result of these credits being placed on ""credit watch"" by rating agencies, causing volatility and speculation of further credit deterioration. Higher Vulnerability to economic cycles During economic downturns, unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities are typically more susceptible to price volatility and fall more in value than investment grade Debt Securities as i) investors may reevaluate holdings in lower-quality bonds in favor of investment-grade corporate Debt Securities; ii) investors become more risk averse; and iii) default risk rises_ This is often referred to a ""flight to quality' Event Risk This includes any of a variety of events that can adversely affect the issuer of unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities, and therefore the issuer's ability to meet debt service obligations to repay principal and interest to Debt Securities holders. Event risk may pertain to the issuer specifically, the industry or business sector of the issuer, or generally upon the overall economy: It could have a direct or indirect impact on the issuer and their outstanding debts. Important Disclosure on RMB Risk relating to RMB _ If you choose RMB as the base currency or the alternate currency, you should also note the following: RMB is currently not freely convertible through banks in Hong Kong Due to exchange controls andlor restrictions imposed on the convertibility, utilization or transferability of RMB (if any) which in turn is affected by, amongst other things, the PRC government's control, there is no guarantee that disruption in the transferability, convertibility or liquidity of RMB will not occur: There is thus a likelihood that you may not be able to convert RMB received into other freely convertible currencies CNH exchange rates and CNY exchange rates are currently quoted in different markets with different exchange rates, whereby their exchange rate movements may not be in the same direction or magnitude. Therefore, the CNH exchange rate may be different from the CNY exchange rate_ citi",easyocr

Certain high-volatility investments can be subject to sudden and large falls in value that could equal the amount invested: Important Disclosure on High Yield Bonds Unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities typically offer a higher yield than investment grade Debt Securities, but also present greater risks with respect to liquidity, volatility , and non-payment of principal and interest: As a result of being classified as non investment grade Debt Securities, these Debt Securities present a greater degree of credit risk relative to many other fixed income Debt Securities_ Higher Credit Risk Unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities generally have predominantly speculative characteristics with respect to the issuer's capacity to pay interest and repay principal_ There is greater risk of non-payment of interest and loss of principal. Many issuers of these Debt Securities have experienced substantial difficulties in servicing their debt obligations, which has led to default and restructurings. The issuers of these Debt Securities generally have to pay a higher rate of interest than investment grade Debt Securities. Higher Liquidity and Secondary Market Risk _ The markets in which unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities are traded are generally more limited than those in which investment grade Debt Securities are traded: This lack of liquidity may make it more difficult to resell these Debt Securities and obtain market quotations Downgrade Risk Downgrades in the credit rating of unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities by rating agencies are generally accompanied by declines in the market value of these Debt Securities. In some circumstances, investors in the unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities market may anticipate such downgrades as a result of these credits being placed on ""credit watch"" by rating agencies, causing volatility and speculation of further credit deterioration. Higher Vulnerability to economic cycles During economic downturns, unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities are typically more susceptible to price volatility and fall more in value than investment grade Debt Securities as i) investors may reevaluate holdings in lower-quality bonds in favor of investment-grade corporate Debt Securities; ii) investors become more risk averse; and iii) default risk rises_ This is often referred to a ""flight to quality' Event Risk This includes any of a variety of events that can adversely affect the issuer of unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities, and therefore the issuer's ability to meet debt service obligations to repay principal and interest to Debt Securities holders. Event risk may pertain to the issuer specifically, the industry or business sector of the issuer, or generally upon the overall economy: It could have a direct or indirect impact on the issuer and their outstanding debts. Important Disclosure on RMB Risk relating to RMB _ If you choose RMB as the base currency or the alternate currency, you should also note the following: RMB is currently not freely convertible through banks in Hong Kong Due to exchange controls andlor restrictions imposed on the convertibility, utilization or transferability of RMB (if any) which in turn is affected by, amongst other things, the PRC government's control, there is no guarantee that disruption in the transferability, convertibility or liquidity of RMB will not occur: There is thus a likelihood that you may not be able to convert RMB received into other freely convertible currencies CNH exchange rates and CNY exchange rates are currently quoted in different markets with different exchange rates, whereby their exchange rate movements may not be in the same direction or magnitude. Therefore, the CNH exchange rate may be different from the CNY exchange rate_ citi",easyocr

Important Disclosure on High Yield Bonds Unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities typically offer a higher yield than investment grade Debt Securities, but also present greater risks with respect to liquidity, volatility, and non-payment of principal and interest. As a result of being classified as non investment grade Debt Securities, these Debt Securities present a greater degree of credit risk relative to many other fixed income Debt Securities_ Higher Credit Risk - Unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities generally have predominantly speculative characteristics with respect to the issuer's capacity to pay interest and repay principal: There is greater risk ofnon-payment of interest and loss of principal. Many issuers ofthese Debt Securities have experienced substantial difficulties in servicing their debt obligations, which has led to default and restructurings. The issuers ofthese Debt Securities generally have to pay a higher rate of interest than investment grade Debt Securities: Higher Liquidity and Secondary Market Risk The markets in which unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities are traded are generally more limited than those in which investment grade Debt Securities are traded: This lack of liquidity may make it more difficult to resell these Debt Securities and obtain market quotations Downgrade Risk Downgrades in the credit rating of unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities by rating agencies are generally accompanied by declines in the market value of these Debt Securities. In some circumstances, investors in the unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities market may anticipate such downgrades as a result of these credits being placed on ""credit watch by rating agencies, causing volatility and speculation of further credit deterioration. Higher Vulnerability to economic cycles During economic downturns, unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities are typically more susceptible to price volatility and fall more in value than investment grade Debt Securities as i) investors may reevaluate holdings in lower-quality bonds in favor of investment-grade corporate Debt Securities; ii) investors become more risk averse; and iii) default risk rises. This is often referred to a ""flight to quality Event Risk - This includes any of a variety of events that can adversely affect the issuer of unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities, and therefore the issuer' s ability to meet debt service obligations to repay principal and interest to Debt Securities holders Event risk may pertain to the issuer specifically, the industry or business sector ofthe issuer, or generally upon the overall economy: It could have a direct or indirect impacton theissuer and their outstanding debts_ Important Disclosure on RMB Risk relating to RMB - Ifyou choose RMB as the base currency or the alternate currency, you should also note the following: RMB is currently not freely convertible through banks in Hong Kong: Due to exchange controls and/or restrictions imposed on the convertibility, utilization or transferability of RMB (ifany) which in turn is affected by, amongst other things, the PRC government's control, there is no guarantee that disruption in the transferability, convertibility or liquidity of RMB will not occur: There is thus a likelihood that you may not be able to convert RMB received into other freely convertible currencies CNH exchange rates and CNY exchange rates are currently quoted in different markets with different exchange rates, whereby their exchange rate movements may not be in the same direction or magnitude. Therefore, the CNH exchange rate may be different from the CNY exchange rate",easyocr

Nonetheless, 2022 was an extremely challenging year in financial markets The investment rationale for the classic 60% stocks 40% bonds portfolio is that it will deliver solid if not spectacular returns. As of October; the 60/40 portfolio was on track to match its worst year for performance since the Second World War Sharply rising bond yields were a key reason: They weighed on ultra-long duration assets like equities, with the Nasdaq down almost 30% year-to-date. Beyond 60/40, we saw major rotations in style with value stocks bucking the trend of recent years and outperforming growth: In currency markets, the US dollar surged and the Japanese yen had a year to forget: Navigating geopolitical tensions has increasingly become an occupational hazard for investors. The conflict in Ukraine has had a profound impact on global commodity prices, amplifying inflation, and forcing Europe to re-think its energy policies This will have major implications for industry structure and living standards for years to come: Meanwhile, markets are watching Sino-US relations closely, fearful that tensions over Taiwan could escalate. No doubt 2023 will bring fresh sources of volatility But that volatility should be seen as an opportunity for an active manager: It is our job to make sense of the evolving macroeconomic landscape, position accordingly, and translate the market moves into strong performance for our clients. We remain convinced that a relentless focus on sustainability is an essential ingredient within that investment process and we do not accept that there is a conflict between delivering strong performance for clients and embedding sustainability in everything we do. On the contrary, we view sustainable investing as an opportunity, rather than a constraint: We have just published Committed to climate: Our net zero roadmap which spells out how we will align our portfolios with the goal of reaching net zero emissions. hope that you will remain partners with Us on the journey to net zero investing:",easyocr

One open question is whether wage inflation can be reduced without a large increase in unemployment: The number of job vacancies relative to the size of the labour force Is still about twice the long-run averagel, meaning companies are forced to raise wages to attract workers (see Exhibit 1). Historically, vacancies only decline significantly when the unemployment rate rises The US Federal Reserve believes that the currently high number of vacancies reflects the reorganisation of the labour market and the economy following the pandemic. As that process ends, vacancies could fall without the unemployment rate necessarily rising: There is another reason to believe the unemployment rate may not rise very much: US companies have learned from the lockdown recession that firing employees may reduce costs in the short term,; but it creates problems later on They may move towards a more European model, where employees are kept on the payroll through a recession, allowing for a swifter and smoother recovery later: Offsetting the drag from higher policy rates will be the ongoing investments triggered by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, and the Inflation Reduction Act, which will direct nearly USD 400 billion in tax credits and subsidies for numerous clean energy programmes 1 As of November 2022 Exhibit 1: Wage gains will only slow once job openings fall Openings as % of civilian labour force (CLF) and employment cost index 7 Job openings (% of CLF) 6 6 Compensation (Yoy %) 5 5 4 4 3 3 2 2 1 1 2000 2005 2010 2015 2020 Data as at August 2022.

Inflation is in double digits in some countries, consumer sentiment has collapsed, and demand is weakening along with disposable income Nonetheless, we believe headline inflation has peaked and will return to the ECB's 2% target in 2024. The response of governments to economic shocks has changed since the pandemic Instead of counting on automatic stabilisers such as unemployment insurance to tide households through the downturn; governments have resorted to more direct support to mitigate any decline in income (or corporate profits): This strategy was comparatively easy during the pandemic as policy rates and inflation were low and central banks were purchasing government debt: The recent experience of the UK however; shows the limits of these policies now that inflation is well above target and central banks are looking to reduce the size of their balance sheets While Germany can afford a EUR 200 billion support package, other countries may not: When Italian government bond yields were above 4% prior to the global financial crisis, the country's debt was afew percentage points less than its GDP It is now 40% greater: In 2022, debt-GDP ratios nonetheless improved, but in 2023, they will likely see a deterioration.

For example, an investor in a portfolio of 60% global equities and 40% government bonds had lost an eye-watering 2O% by late October: That is a far cry from the 9-10% she or he would have grown accustomed to making over the last 50-odd years. These losses were the steepest incurred in a generation including 2008,which saw losses of 'just' 14%. We, as others, had seen this steep rise in real yields as the chief risk facing financial markets in 2022. Our multi-asset portfolios were short duration, neutral equities (through a combination of long Asia and short Europe)  and long commoditiesfor much of 2022. Yet, as sovereign bond yields, particularly real yields, quickly approached post-GFC highs, we took profits on our long-"" standing short in government bonds One of the biggest questions for 2023 is how soon central banks will pause, or even reverse, their discount rate increases and what impact this will have on the value of cash flows across asset classes.

But there are good reasons, too, for them to pause for breath; with mounting headwinds for both inflation and growth. Persistently high inflation has tested central bank credibility Persistently high inflation has tested central bank credibility, forcing them to set interest rates in the 'rear view mirror'.

Sustainable investment regulations have grown globally from below 50 in 2015 to more than 500.1 Tackling ESG criticism Here, we explore some of the criticisms Often, they go too far and warrant a closer look on the basis of the following: ESG has been an attention grabber; not a distraction.

What's your counterfactual? Admittedly, many environmental and social indicators have worsened over the past 2Qyears: But would the environment and society be better off if the investment industry had ignored ESG as was largely the case before 20042 That is unlikely: ESG is just data At the most basic Level, ESG indicators convey dispassionate information about company management that can materially impact results.

Central bank policy rates and interest rates across maturities rose at the fastest pace in decades, driving bond prices down by unprecedented amounts Oil and natural gas prices gyrated as the Nord Stream 2 project was halted and other energy export sanctions were imposed on Russia. Financial markets were further roiled by growing global geopolitical tensions following the invasion of Ukraine but also aggressive posturing by China, including toward Taiwan. This year is likely to be less tumultuous for markets Inflation is already trending lower: Central banks are expected to continue to tighten, but not to the extent seen in 2022. As a result, bonds will come under less pressure.

Still others recommended adding trading strategies, including hedge funds and momentum- and volatility-based strategies. The proliferation of such recommendations prompted some of our clients to ask whether they should reevaluate their strategic asset allocation accordingly: Our response is twofold. First, appropriate, customized diversification for both institutional and private wealth clients has been a key pillar of the Investment Strategy Group's (ISGs) investment philosophy since its inception more than 20 years ago in 2001 (see Exhibit 2). Such diversification around a core holding of equities and bonds already includes asset classes and investment strategies that enhance riskIreturn to preserve and then maximize risk-adjusted wealth, especially at times of heightened uncertainty: Second, nearly a hundred years of data demonstrates that a mixture of stocks and bonds is an effective starting point for a portfolio, consistent with another pillar of ISGs investment philosophy that history is a useful guide. The 60/40 portfolio has generated positive returns o a rolling 12-month basis 80% of the time since 1926.

Turmoil in financial markets coupled with heightened geopolitical risks has raised the risks, though not the certainty; of a recession. Historically, rapid and extensive tightening by the Federal Reserve has led to recession in the US. Many economists expect it: Bill Dudley, who served as president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, vice chair of the Federal Reserve Open Market Committee (FOMC) and Goldman Sachs partner; assigns a 70% probability to a US recession in 2023_~one of the highest probability forecasts in the industry: At the other extreme, Jan Hatzius, currently Goldman Sachs' chief economist and head of Global Investment Research, assigns a 35% probability to a US recession one of the lowest in the industry Incidentally, Dudley and Hatzius developed the Goldman Sachs Financial Conditions Index while they worked together at Goldman Sachs The index measures the impact of Federal Reserve policy on the economy through the impact on the financial markets, specifically on short- and intermediate-maturity interest rates, equity markets, incremental yield of corporate bonds and the value of the trade-weighted dollar relative to other currencies. The wide difference between the forecasts of these two former colleagues is mirrored across the economic forecasting community Notably, in his latest press conference; on December 14,2022, Jerome H.

Summers, Harvard University professor and former US Treasury secretary wrote that ""there is no basis for confident economic prediction. Some of the most stridently made arguments are also the silliest.""8 When Chair Powell says that %its just not knowable; we take heed; we assign a range of 45-55% to the probability of a US recession in 2023. To provide context: over the last decade, the highest probability we assigned to a recession was 30%. That was in our 2012 Outlook, after the European sovereign debt crisis; the next-highest probability was 20-25%,in our 2020 Outlook. Today, many leading indicators are pointing in opposite directions, and we believe it is important to convey this uncertainty to our clients unequivocally: In this uncertain environment, we believe portfolios should not be positioned for the certainty of recession nor for the certainty of modest economic growth: Instead, we recommend portfolios be positioned at their customized strategic asset allocation, where they are designed to ride out volatility and provide staying power in the event of geopolitical disruptions If a recession is averted, financial market returns in 2023 will be less volatile than in 2022; we expect a moderate-risk diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds to provide a total return of 9.0% for taxable clients and 9.8% for tax-exempt clients. If a recession occurs early in the year, corporate earnings and equities will decline~possibly beyond the maximum drawdown of 2022-_~but bonds will hedge the portfolio by increasing in value, because the starting point of interest rates is much higher than it was at the beginning of 2022. However, by the end of 2023, as the recession recedes and the fog of uncertainty lifts, the equity market will most likely rally: We would expect high-single-digit returns for a moderate-risk diversified portfolio. If the recession lasts beyond year-end, the equity market will most likely end the year near the lows we saw in 202.2, providing a total return of negative 4.4% from year-end 2022 and resulting in a low- to mid-single-digit negative return for a moderate-risk portfolio Facing the fog of uncertainty in financial markets, economic growth and geopolitics, we will on our side: Outlook Investment Strategy Group",easyocr

US Preeminence leads us to overweight US assets in our strategic asset allocation. Staying Invested drives our recommendation that clients maintain their strategic asset allocation; that recommendation will change if we develop high conviction that a recession is imminent and not already discounted by the market. Currently, we do not have high conviction that a recession is imminent and one has already been partially discounted by the equity market decline. The key takeaways from our 2023 Outlook are as follows: Below-Trend Growth: We expect global economic growth to slow to below-trend levels. We believe the US will have modest growth; the Eurozone, the UK and Russia will be in recession; and that Japan will be an exception with above-trend growth. Large emerging market countries will grow below trend at mid-single-digit growth levels, in our view. We estimate Chinas post-COVID recovery will reach 4.9%, just above trend levels of 4-4.5%_ Monetary Policy Tightening: We believe that most major central banks will continue tightening monetary policy but at a more modest pace than in 2022. China will be a key exception as the leadership tries to stem the declines in the property sector: Recession Risk in the US: We have assigned a 45-55% range to the risk of recession in 2023.

6,jpmorgan_private_banking_global_view_2023,Unknown,Unknown,43,"STRONGER MARKETS Once-booming private markets have started to feelthe strain that is all but inescapable in public markets: Growth equity funds, real estate vehicles and private credit managers have all experienced varying degrees of markdowns on their assets, and more seem likely: More immediately; the drought of public capital market activity in 2022 means that private market investors can earn a premium for providing both debt and equity financing: Companies that were planning on an initial public offering in 2022 or 2023 are holding back, given the valuation reset. Instead, many of these firms are turning to private investors for bridge capital, and private lenders can now demand higher interest rates from potential borrowers. On the other hand, other alternative investments such as hedge funds that focus on rates, currencies and cross-asset correlations had a banner year and proved their worth as portfolio diversifiers. In 2023, gold may serve a similar purpose as the dollar and real interest rates find their peaks. Similarly, secondary private equity offerings, which have historically demonstrated higher net IRRs (internal rates of return) with more limited manager dispersion than other types of private equity investments, could provide an opportunity to acquire discounted assets from owners who are willing to accept a markdown in exchange for immediate liquidity: Supply in this area has increased because some institutional investors need to sell illiquid assets to maintain their proper allocations, given the sell-off in both stocks and bonds this year: 44",easyocr

Many sectors, such as residential real estate (U.S. housing stock has been underbuilt by ~1.5 million homes) , shipping (there are only 111 active large shipyards today versus 320 in 2008), and natural resources (large-cap energv capex is down 60% since 2015) have seen a decade of underinvestment that curtails capacity: The investment shortfall presents opportunity for both vield and total return, though cyclical risks should be taken into account. 45",easyocr

We believe markets could stabilize even as the economy worsens in 2023.

Many issuers of these Debt Securities have experienced substantial difficulties in servicing their debt obligations, which has led to default and restructurings. The issuers of these Debt Securities generally have to pay a higher rate of interest than investment grade Debt Securities. Higher Liquidity and Secondary Market Risk _ The markets in which unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities are traded are generally more limited than those in which investment grade Debt Securities are traded: This lack of liquidity may make it more difficult to resell these Debt Securities and obtain market quotations Downgrade Risk Downgrades in the credit rating of unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities by rating agencies are generally accompanied by declines in the market value of these Debt Securities. In some circumstances, investors in the unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities market may anticipate such downgrades as a result of these credits being placed on ""credit watch"" by rating agencies, causing volatility and speculation of further credit deterioration. Higher Vulnerability to economic cycles During economic downturns, unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities are typically more susceptible to price volatility and fall more in value than investment grade Debt Securities as i) investors may reevaluate holdings in lower-quality bonds in favor of investment-grade corporate Debt Securities; ii) investors become more risk averse; and iii) default risk rises_ This is often referred to a ""flight to quality' Event Risk This includes any of a variety of events that can adversely affect the issuer of unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities, and therefore the issuer's ability to meet debt service obligations to repay principal and interest to Debt Securities holders. Event risk may pertain to the issuer specifically, the industry or business sector of the issuer, or generally upon the overall economy: It could have a direct or indirect impact on the issuer and their outstanding debts. Important Disclosure on RMB Risk relating to RMB _ If you choose RMB as the base currency or the alternate currency, you should also note the following: RMB is currently not freely convertible through banks in Hong Kong Due to exchange controls andlor restrictions imposed on the convertibility, utilization or transferability of RMB (if any) which in turn is affected by, amongst other things, the PRC government's control, there is no guarantee that disruption in the transferability, convertibility or liquidity of RMB will not occur: There is thus a likelihood that you may not be able to convert RMB received into other freely convertible currencies CNH exchange rates and CNY exchange rates are currently quoted in different markets with different exchange rates, whereby their exchange rate movements may not be in the same direction or magnitude.

11,goldman_sachs_global_view_2023,Unknown,Unknown,0,"Strategic Advisory Solutions SPECIAL EDITION ~ 10 FOR 2023 Goldman Sachs Asset Management MARKET PULSE 10 FOR 2023 1_ ECONOMIC GROWTH: On the heels of an aggressive tightening in financial conditions and restrictive monetary policy in 2022, GIR expects global growth to move below trend to 1.8% in 2023. Investors may be underestimating the resilience of the US economy, which contrasts with a mild recession in Europe and a bumpy reopening in China. 2. INFLATION: Prices will likely slowly cool, with notable improvement in the policy-critical areas of shelter and wages. Supply chains have functioned better, with further improvements likely if China implements a more flexible COVID-19 strategy. Still, wage growth and long-term inflation expectations are likely key factors in forward monetary policy: 3. MONETARY POLICY: Sticky inflation remains the preeminent global concern, locking central banks (CB) into a pause-over-pivot bias in 2023. Consequently, CBs are eager to nudge growth below potential: In the US, GIR expects a terminal rate of 5-5.25% and no cuts in 2023. In the Euro area and UK, terminal rates may reach 3.00% and 4.50%, respectively: 4. GEOPOLITICS: Acute geopolitical dynamics remain present as ever, hallmarked by conflict in Ukraine, territorial flexing by China, and entrenched societal polarization. On the latter we expect increasing uncertainty in government composition and policy: 5. DM EQUITY: Rising cost of capital should accelerate the transition from highly bifurcated macro to deeply idiosyncratic drivers of return: To compete with compelling cross-asset opportunities, we believe a focus on profits over revenue, quality over capitalization, and company over country, is warranted: As current macro risks remain unresolved, a US equity tilt appears warranted, but the attractive cyclicality and potential FX tailwinds of non-US equities may emerge in 2023. 6. EM EQUITY: EM equities face a challenging composition of subpar growth and a sharp tightening in financial conditions. However, we believe pockets of value may exist in EMs that are closer to relief from inflation and rates, including Brazil, Chile, and Korea 7 . RATES: Global yields will likely move in tandem with CB policy paths, with potential differentiation due to regional energy exposure. GIR forecasts rates to top out in 1H 2023, though acknowledge the risk to the upside given policymakers' willingness to overshoot: Globally, we believe the deepest level of curve inversion is behind uS_ ASSET CLASS VIEWSI Less Favorable Shorter Term More Favorable Longer Term EQUITY US Equity European Equity Japanese Equity Emerging Market (EM) Equity RATES US Government Fixed Income DM Government Fixed Income EM Debt Local Municipal Bonds CREDIT US Investment Grade US High Yield Euro Area Corporates Asia High Yield EM Debt Hard REAL ASSETS Oil Copper Gold Global Real Estate CURRENCIES US Dollar Euro British Pound Japanese Yen Chinese Renminbi ASSET CLASS FORECASTS?

CURRENCY: Near-term US dollar strength may persist as global growth risk is to the downside_ Over the longer term, the US dollar looks vulnerable to high valuation and global recovery. Should the global growth-inflation mix improve, the USD is likely to rebate recent gains. 10.

11,goldman_sachs_global_view_2023,Unknown,Unknown,1,"MARKET PULSE: SPECIAL EDITION 5 10 FOR 2023 Point Break We expect 2023 to be a year filled with macro inflection points as inflation and monetary policy pressures start to diminish: Alongside this transition, we believe investor prioritization of profitability over revenue and sticky income over the uncertainty of capital appreciation will be paramount: Market opportunities have already reset and investing next year may feature more of 1) stocks with durable cash flows, 2) quality bonds with significant coupons, and 3) alternatives with volatility-reducing attributes. SUPPLY TIMELINES: The share of manufacturing companies reporting faster supplier delivery times has increased 171% since the beginning of 20221 WORKING HOURS: Global labor supply remains squeezed. The ILO estimates total work hours to stay 1.5% below pre-pandemic levels, equating to a deficit of 4Omm full-time jobs? TRAVEL SURGE: The daily number of passengers screened at TSA checkpoints has jumped by 17x relative to the pandemic low in 20203. ACTIVITY HOME EQUITY: Only 2% of US mortgages have negative equity today versus 25% in 20114. Home prices would need to fall by 30% from 2021 levels to meaningfully erode loan- to-value ratios and increase strategic defaults. CREDIT TRENDS: While US loan delinquencies remain subdued, spending has rotated from discretionary to essential; top areas of credit acceleration-~automotive parts , gas, and materials-__have discouraged borrowing for recreation, clothing, and food servicess. BAD MOOD: The UMichigan Consumer Sentiment Index printed below 60 in seven consecutive months, the longest stretch since inception as sticky costs diminish morale6 CONSUMERS SINGLE STOCK: As of 3Q, 80% of S&P 500 companies have seen their equity prices fall at least 10% at some point this year, providing a large base for tax-loss harvesting UP DOWN: Performance swings have been more volatile this year relative to the long-term average. Positive days in 2022 have returned a daily average of 1.31% while negative days have posted an average drag of -1.14%, much wider than the historical bounds of +0.75%7 . TECH BREAK: The market value loss for mega tech stocks this year is equivalent to the annual GDP of UK or France8. EQUITIES YIELD LAGGARD: A year ago, ~25% of global government debt offered negative nominal yields. Today, Japan is the last remaining sovereign borrower with negative-yielding debt;, comprising <5% of all government debt8. COST BENEFIT: Rate volatility has exceeded the 90th percentile relative to the past ten years. Still, US Treasuries are yielding 5.5x more per unit of volatility than US stocks8. DURATION LIMITS: The risk and cost of a rate shock are lower and less punitive today relative to earlier this year. While a 100 bp rate shock may drag the Bloomberg US Aggregate Bond Index by -6.2%, a coupon offset of 2.7% may ultimately limit left-tail risks9.

The US should narrowly avoid recession as core PCE inflation slows from 5% now to 3% in late 2023 with a Yzpp rise in the unemployment rate . To keep growth below potential amidst stronger real income growth, we now see the Fed hiking another 125bp to a peak of 5-5.25% _ We don't expect cuts in 2023. How can core inflation fall so much with such a small employment hit? The reason, we think, is that this cycle is different from prior high-inflation periods. First, post-pandemic labor market overheating showed up not in excessive employment but in unprecedented job openings, which are much less painful to unwind: Second, the disinflationary impact of the recent normalization in supply chains and rental housing markets still has a long way to go. And third, long-term inflation expectations remain well-anchored: The Euro area and the UK are probably in recession, mainly because of the real income hit from surging energy bills. But we expect only a mild downturn as Europe has already managed to cut Russian gas imports without crushing activity and is likely to benefit from the same post-pandemic improvements that are helping avoid US recession: Given reduced risks of a deep downturn and persistent inflation, we now expect hikes through May with a 3% ECB peak: China is likely to grow slowly in H1 as an April reopening initially triggers an increase in Covid cases that keeps caution high, but should accelerate sharply in H2 on a reopening boost. Our longer-run China view remains cautious because of the long slide in the property market as well as slower potential growth (reflecting weakness in both demographics and productivity). Several central banks in Central/Eastern Europe and Latin America started hiking rates well before their DM peers. While none has clearly achieved a soft landing yet; activity has been resilient and inflation is now coming down in some countries, especially Brazil. CEE is in a more difficult position because of its commodity exposure, high inflation, and ongoing monetary tightening: Jan Hatzius +1(2121902-0394 janhatzius@gs.com Goldman Sachs & Co.

One immediate reason is that the incoming activity data are nowhere close to recessionary: The advance GDP report showed 2.6% (annualized) growth in Q3, nonfarm payrolls grew 261k in October; and there were 225k initial jobless claims in the week of November 5. More fundamentally, there are strong reasons to expect positive growth in coming quarters: To be sure, the tightening in financial conditions is weighing heavily on growth, to the tune of nearly 2pp at present: But real disposable personal income is rebounding from the plunge seen in H1-_~when fiscal tightening and sharply higher inflation took their toll_to a pace of 3%+over the next year (Exhibit 4). And while there are risks on both sides, we think the real income upturn is likely to be the stronger force as we move through 2023, especially because the financial conditions drag will likely diminish assuming Fed officials do not deliver dramatically more tightening than the rates market is currently pricing: 16 November 2022",easyocr

On the goods side, the ongoing rotation from goods to services spending, healing supply chains, and rebounding inventory levels should put downward pressure on core goods prices: On the services side, asking rents on new leases have decelerated sharply after the one-time jump in rents related to the work from home-related increase in demand for space. The October CPI report suggests that the lagging measure of sequential monthly official CPI shelter inflation_which captures both new and continuing leases_has likely peaked too.

Measures of short-term inflation expectations remain relatively high, but much of this probably reflects the spike in commodity prices and should wane if commodity prices level off.

Already, Europe has cut Russian gas imports by 80% and total gas consumption by 20-25% without crushing aggregate activity: In fact, most of the hard economic data (as opposed to the surveys) continue to hold up remarkably well so far; with industrial production moving sideways, real GDP still up in the Euro area in Q3 (though down slightly in the UK), and labor markets holding up so far We think the reason for this resilience is that household energy savings and substitution to other energy sources have helped absorb the collapse in Russian gas imports. Along with mild weather; these savings have boosted gas storage, reduced TTF gas prices by 60% from their peak, and reduced downside risk from a very cold winter: Moreover; Europe is likely to benefit from three similar post-pandemic sources of resilience that are helping the US avoid recession altogether: First, Exhibit 14 shows that the rise in German production of chip-intensive items and cars-~where pandemic bottlenecks are still easing has approximately offset the ongoing decline in energy-intensive production: 16 November 2022 12",easyocr

What about European core inflation? Although commodities drove the initial headline surge , price pressures have broadened significantly across core categories in both the Euro area and the UK following upside inflation surprises (Exhibit 16, left panel). In fact, UK core price pressures are now the broadest across the G10, with a perfect storm of an energy crisis (like continental Europe) and an overheated labor market (like the US). Given this strong momentum, we expect Euro area core inflation to edge up further to a peak of 5.3% year-over-year in December; before gradually declining to just above 3% by end-2023 on goods disinflation: In the UK, we think that core inflation is peaking right around now and will also decline to 3% by end-2023.

In contrast; we look for a meaningful reopening growth boost in H2, which will likely extend into 2024.

We are reasonably optimistic, but there are substantial risks to our view: One risk is that inflation pressures simply remain pervasive enough that central banks have no choice but to keep tightening aggressively: If sO, a recession might become unavoidable, not just in Europe but also in the US. The recent news flow has reduced this risk slightly in the US, as the labor market continues to adjust and inflation has begun to slow: But the picture is not uniform: Central banks in Europe and those EM economies where inflation is still increasing may be forced into further tightening in an environment of exchange rate depreciation and rising inflation expectations. The other main risk is that underlying inflation does come down; but central banks are late in recognizing the improvement because they are too focused on lagging indicators of inflation such as CPI shelter inflation. In the US, we have recently become a little less concerned about this risk as well: Fed officials have made it clear that they are not exclusively focused on the CPI rent numbers but also on more leading indicators such as asking rents on new leases, which have slowed sharply in recent months. Moreover; many central banks have either already slowed their hiking pace or signaled that they will do so soon: This reduces the risk of overtightening as it will allow for more time to assess the impact of higher rates on the economy: Beyond the core inflation dynamic, we remain concerned about political and geopolitical 16 November 2022 20",easyocr

Moreover; the latest meeting between Presidents Biden and Xi promises to defuse at least some of the tensions between the US and China, which might also help to achieve a negotiated solution to the Russia-Ukraine war: But there are still plenty of risks that could return us to the exceptionally volatile environment of the first half of 2022. So far; a settlement in the Russia-Ukraine war does not seem close at hand, and the impact of the price cap on Russian oil is uncertain: The political instability in the Middle East-__while far from a new feature of the geopolitical order also has the potential to deal another blow to energy markets at a time when the supply-demand balance is already precarious. Thus, our cautiously optimistic global economic outlook remains fraught with substantial risks. 16 November 2022 21",easyocr

Many issuers of these Debt Securities have experienced substantial difficulties in servicing their debt obligations, which has led to default and restructurings. The issuers of these Debt Securities generally have to pay a higher rate of interest than investment grade Debt Securities. Higher Liquidity and Secondary Market Risk _ The markets in which unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities are traded are generally more limited than those in which investment grade Debt Securities are traded: This lack of liquidity may make it more difficult to resell these Debt Securities and obtain market quotations Downgrade Risk Downgrades in the credit rating of unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities by rating agencies are generally accompanied by declines in the market value of these Debt Securities. In some circumstances, investors in the unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities market may anticipate such downgrades as a result of these credits being placed on ""credit watch"" by rating agencies, causing volatility and speculation of further credit deterioration. Higher Vulnerability to economic cycles During economic downturns, unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities are typically more susceptible to price volatility and fall more in value than investment grade Debt Securities as i) investors may reevaluate holdings in lower-quality bonds in favor of investment-grade corporate Debt Securities; ii) investors become more risk averse; and iii) default risk rises_ This is often referred to a ""flight to quality' Event Risk This includes any of a variety of events that can adversely affect the issuer of unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities, and therefore the issuer's ability to meet debt service obligations to repay principal and interest to Debt Securities holders. Event risk may pertain to the issuer specifically, the industry or business sector of the issuer, or generally upon the overall economy: It could have a direct or indirect impact on the issuer and their outstanding debts. Important Disclosure on RMB Risk relating to RMB _ If you choose RMB as the base currency or the alternate currency, you should also note the following: RMB is currently not freely convertible through banks in Hong Kong Due to exchange controls andlor restrictions imposed on the convertibility, utilization or transferability of RMB (if any) which in turn is affected by, amongst other things, the PRC government's control, there is no guarantee that disruption in the transferability, convertibility or liquidity of RMB will not occur: There is thus a likelihood that you may not be able to convert RMB received into other freely convertible currencies CNH exchange rates and CNY exchange rates are currently quoted in different markets with different exchange rates, whereby their exchange rate movements may not be in the same direction or magnitude. Therefore, the CNH exchange rate may be different from the CNY exchange rate_ citi",easyocr

Many issuers of these Debt Securities have experienced substantial difficulties in servicing their debt obligations, which has led to default and restructurings. The issuers of these Debt Securities generally have to pay a higher rate of interest than investment grade Debt Securities. Higher Liquidity and Secondary Market Risk _ The markets in which unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities are traded are generally more limited than those in which investment grade Debt Securities are traded: This lack of liquidity may make it more difficult to resell these Debt Securities and obtain market quotations Downgrade Risk Downgrades in the credit rating of unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities by rating agencies are generally accompanied by declines in the market value of these Debt Securities. In some circumstances, investors in the unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities market may anticipate such downgrades as a result of these credits being placed on ""credit watch"" by rating agencies, causing volatility and speculation of further credit deterioration. Higher Vulnerability to economic cycles During economic downturns, unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities are typically more susceptible to price volatility and fall more in value than investment grade Debt Securities as i) investors may reevaluate holdings in lower-quality bonds in favor of investment-grade corporate Debt Securities; ii) investors become more risk averse; and iii) default risk rises_ This is often referred to a ""flight to quality' Event Risk This includes any of a variety of events that can adversely affect the issuer of unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities, and therefore the issuer's ability to meet debt service obligations to repay principal and interest to Debt Securities holders. Event risk may pertain to the issuer specifically, the industry or business sector of the issuer, or generally upon the overall economy: It could have a direct or indirect impact on the issuer and their outstanding debts. Important Disclosure on RMB Risk relating to RMB _ If you choose RMB as the base currency or the alternate currency, you should also note the following: RMB is currently not freely convertible through banks in Hong Kong Due to exchange controls andlor restrictions imposed on the convertibility, utilization or transferability of RMB (if any) which in turn is affected by, amongst other things, the PRC government's control, there is no guarantee that disruption in the transferability, convertibility or liquidity of RMB will not occur: There is thus a likelihood that you may not be able to convert RMB received into other freely convertible currencies CNH exchange rates and CNY exchange rates are currently quoted in different markets with different exchange rates, whereby their exchange rate movements may not be in the same direction or magnitude. Therefore, the CNH exchange rate may be different from the CNY exchange rate_ citi",easyocr

15,jpmorgan_asset_management_Q1_2023,Unknown,Unknown,69,"J.P Morgan Asset Management Definitions GTM US: 70 Investments in emerging markets can be more volatile. The normal risks of investing in foreign countries are heightened when investing in emerging markets. In addition, the small size of securities markets and the low trading volume may lead to a lack of liquidity, which leads to increased volatility. Also, emerging markets may not provide adequate legal protection for private or foreign investment or private property: The price of equity securities may rise, or fall because of changes in the broad market or changes in a company's financial condition; sometimes rapidly or unpredictably: These price movements may result from factors affecting individual companies, sectors or industries, or the securities market as a whole, such as changes in economic or political conditions. Equity securities are subject to ""stock market risk"" meaning that stock prices in general may decline over short or extended periods of time. Equity market neutral strategies employ sophisticated quantitative techniques of analyzing price data to ascertain information about future price movement and relationships between securities, select securities for purchase and sale. Equity Market Neutral Strategies typically maintain characteristic net equity market exposure no greater than 10% long or short: Global macro strategies trade a broad range of strategies in which the investment process is predicated on movements in underlying economic variables and the impact these have on equity, fixed income; hard currency and commodity markets International investing involves a greater degree of risk and increased volatility: Changes in currency exchange rates and differences in accounting and taxation policies outside the U.S. can raise or lower returns. Some overseas markets may not be as politically and economically stable as the United States and other nations. There is no guarantee that the use of long and short positions will succeed in limiting an investor's exposure to domestic stock market movements, capitalization; sector swings or other risk factors. Using long and short selling strategies may have higher portfolio turnover rates. Short selling involves certain risks, including additional costs associated with covering short positions and a possibility of unlimited loss on certain short sale positions. Merger arbitrage strategies which employ an investment process primarily focused on opportunities in equity and equity related instruments of companies which are currently engaged in a corporate transaction Mid-capitalization investing typically carries more risk than investing in well-established ""blue-chip"" companies. Historically, mid-cap companies' stock has experienced a greater degree of market volatility than the average stock Price to forward earnings is a measure of the price-to-earnings ratio (PIE) using forecasted earnings. Price to book value compares a stock's market value to its book value. Price to cash flow 'is a measure of the markets expectations of a firm's future financial health. Price to dividends is the ratio of the price of a share on a stock exchange to the dividends per share paid in the previous year; used as a measure of a company's potential as an investment: Real estate investments may be subject to a higher degree of market risk because of concentration in a specific industry, sector or geographical sector: Real estate investments may be subject to risks including; but not limited to, declines in the value of real estate, risks related to general and economic conditions, changes in the value of the underlying property owned by the trust and defaults by borrower. Relative Value Strategies maintain positions in which the investment thesis is predicated on realization of a valuation discrepancy in the relationship between multiple securities. Small-capitalization investing typically carries more risk than investing in well-established ""blue-chip"" companies since smaller companies generally have a higher risk of failure: Historically, smaller companies' stock has experienced a greater degree of market volatility than the average stock: Other asset classes: The Alerian MLP Index is a composite of the 50 most prominent energy Master Limited Partnerships (MLPs) that provides investors with an unbiased, comprehensive benchmark for the asset class.

The CS/Tremont Hedge Fund Index is compiled by Credit Suisse Tremont Index; LLC. It is an asset-weighted hedge fund index and includes only funds, as opposed to separate accounts. The Index uses the Credit Suisse/Tremont database, which tracks over 4500 funds, and consists only of funds with a minimum of USS50 million under management;a 12-month track record, and audited financial statements. It is calculated and rebalanced on a monthly basis, and shown net of all performance fees and expenses. It is the exclusive property of Credit Suisse Tremont Index; LLC. The HFRI Monthly Indices (HFRI) are equally weighted performance indexes, utilized by numerous hedge fund managers as a benchmark for their own hedge funds. The HFRI are broken down into 4 main strategies, each with multiple sub strategies. AII single-manager HFRI Index constituents are included in the HFRI Fund Weighted Composite; which accounts for over 2200 funds listed on the internal HFR Database_ The NAREIT EQUITY REIT Index is designed to provide the most comprehensive assessment of overall industry performance, and includes all tax-qualified real estate investment trusts (REITs) that are listed on the NYSE, the American Stock Exchange or the NASDAQ National Market List.

The NFI-ODCE Index is capitalization-weighted and is reported gross of fees Measurement is time-weighted: Definitions: Investing in alternative assets involves higher risks than traditional investments and is suitable only for sophisticated investors_ Alternative investments involve greater risks than traditional investments and should not be deemed a complete investment program: They are not tax efficient and an investor should consult with hislher tax advisor prior to investing. Alternative investments have higher fees than traditional investments and they may also be highly leveraged and engage in speculative investment techniques, which can magnify the potential for investment ioss or gain. The value of the investment may fall as well as rise and investors may get back less than they invested. Bonds are subject to interest rate risks. Bond prices generally fall when interest rates rise Investments in commodities may have greater volatility than investments in traditional securities, particularly if the instruments involve leverage. The value of commodity-linked derivative instruments may be affected by changes in overall market movements;, commodity index volatility, changes in interest rates, or factors affecting a particular industry or commodity, such as drought; floods, weather; livestock disease, embargoes; tariffs and international economic, political and regulatory developments. Use of leveraged commodity-linked derivatives creates an opportunity for increased return but; at the same time, creates the possibility for greater loss. Derivatives may be riskier than other types of investments because they may be more sensitive to changes in economic or market conditions than other types of investments and could result in losses that significantly exceed the original investment: The use of derivatives may not be successful, resulting in investment losses, and the cost of such strategies may reduce investment returns. Distressed Restructuring Strategies employ an investment process focused on corporate fixed income instruments, primarily on corporate credit instruments of companies trading at significant discounts to their value at issuance or obliged (par value) at maturity as a result of either formal bankruptcy proceeding or financial market perception of near term proceedings.

DM Earnings Revisions Indices have all recently turned positive, typically a bullish equity signal: This blunts the safe haven appeal ofthe USD. Relative rate momentum, looking at Sy nominal US-G9 rates vs 1OOdMA, still favours RoW. Excess savings in the UK, EA and Japan are higher than in the US as a % of GDP. Big picture, Citi analysts still like USD lower. The convergence trade and subsequent asset reallocation away from the US still makes sense and are already evident in Citi data momentum spreads and equity fund flow data: EUR: China risks are concerning but European recoveryhas other supports The 2022 terms oftrade shock continues to unwind with European gas prices reaching new cyclical lows. Real wages in Europe continue to trend up while excess savings remain at thehighs This also suggests the European recovery can be endogenously consumption lead, rather than reliant on Chinese growth: EUR arguably looks like a next best alternative to USD for reserve managers, where USD allocations have been on downwards trends for the majority ofthe last decade: JPY: Citianalysts see risk that USDJPY goes sideways for the next quarter, as global recession pricing looks vulnerable which can lead yields higher, pressuring JPY. Longer term, Citi analysts expect a US recession in Q4 and risk ofa BoJ policy shift around the same time: The combination ofa material US duration rally, and potentially higher Japanese yields, would dramatically narrow the USD-JPY rate differential: Given uncertainty around the depth ofthe US recession and signs that the US labour market may be stronger for longer, the 6-12m forecast was upgraded to 125 from 120. AUD: Weaker China,_lower commodity prices and doubtful RBA hawkishness to weigh on AUD: Domestically, employment data showed labour markets slowing faster than the RBA forecasts. This adds reasons for RBA to hold and see this summer. Citi analysts now moved their final hike to August: Citi analysts watch closely for any meaningful support from Chinese authorities or credit easing announcement, as a sentiment shift would be hawkish AUD and commodity-linked FX. GBP: UK data improving_BoE want to pivot but data isn't weak enough yet,_The UK has experienced a very positive terms of trade shock, and excess savings in the UK are larger than in US or EA. This could mean that macro divergences between UK and DM peers take longer to set in. Relative data surprise and nominal rate differentials have been a good signpost for these trends. Both have supported the recent GBP rally on the crosses, amid fairly bearish sentiment across the board on the UK. In the longer term, Citi anlaysts stillthink that domestic fragilities in the UK remain in the forecast horizon, which brings on balance larger risk of growth and monetary policy divergences in favour of Europe: #FX TRADING INVOLVES RISKS",easyocr

There is greater risk ofnon-paymentof interest and loss of principal  Many issuers ofthese Debt Securities have experienced substantial difficulties in servicing their debt obligations, which has led to default and restructurings. The issuers ofthese Debt Securities generally have to pay a higher rate ofinterestthan investment grade Debt Securities: Higher Liquidity and Secondary Market Risk The markets in which unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities are traded are generally more limited than those in which investment grade Debt Securities are traded: This lack of liquidity may make it more difficultto resell these Debt Securities and obtain market quotations Downgrade Risk - Downgrades in the credit rating of unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities by rating agencies are generally accompanied by declines in the market value ofthese Debt Securities In some circumstances, investors in the unrated or non investmentgrade Debt Securities market may anticipate such downgrades as a result of these credits being placed on ""credit watch"" by ratingagencies, causing volatility and speculation of further credit deterioration: Higher Vulnerability to economic cycles During economicdownturns, unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities are typically more susceptible to price volatility and fall more in value than investmentgrade Debt Securities as i) investors may reevaluate holdings in lower-quality bonds in favor of investment-grade corporate Debt Securities; ii) investors become more risk averse; and iii) default risk rises.

17,kkr_global_view_2023,Unknown,Unknown,2,"Outlook for 2023: Keep It Simple Despite all the uncertainty across today's global capital markets, we are poised to enter 2023 with a more constructive tilt, especially on many parts of Credit: Our basic premise is that it will be easier to navigate inflation's negative impact on corporate earnings and consumer balance sheets in 2023 than it was to invest with inflation continually surprising central banks and investors in 2022. However; what we are proposing will require both patience and courage and a game plan that leverages the type of long-term frameworks we employ at KKR across asset classes and regions. At its core, our message is to 'Keep it Simple' in 2023. The massive increase we have seen in short-term interest in many instances has created attractive total return opportunities across several parts of the global capital markets without having to stretch on leverage; volatility, and/or risk: Implicit in our outlook is our strong view that now is a good time to be a lender: As such, we continue to lean towards collateral-based cash flows such as Infrastructure; Private Credit; Real Estate Credit and many parts of Asset-Based Finance: We also like some of the convexity that liquid Credit provides after the recent sell-off Within Equities, our advice is to shift away from larger- capitalization Technology stocks in favor of smaller capitalization names with better valuation profiles. History suggests that 2023 will be a good vintage year for Private Equity: We also see the U.S. dollar's strength reversing, which means that many international assets need to be re- considered. Finally, while we see the positive relationship between stocks and bonds easing in 2023, our longer-term view remains that we have entered a regime change that requires a different approach to overall global macro and asset allocation: Truth is ever to be found in the simplicity, and not in the multiplicity and confusion of things.

17,kkr_global_view_2023,Unknown,Unknown,3,"With a higher resting heart rate for inflation amidst record stimu- lus, we have been cautioning for some time that we see a 'dif- ferent kind of recovery' , and that investors should 'walk, not run' when it comes to deployment, especially as the correlation be- tween stocks and bonds turned positive. No doubt, we still think the macro environment remains challenging, but we now feel more emboldened as we think about deployment entering 2023. Key to our thinking are the following considerations Global central banks are much further along in their tightening campaign, As Chairman Powell said recently, rates are 'getting close' to sufficiently restrictive levels. Our work shows that the share of the top 1 25 central banks boosting rates will fall to 12% in 2023, compared to fully 84% in 2022. This decline is a important one to consider, we believe: We also think the chance of the U.S. dollar bull market continuing well into 2023 is now much more limited. This macro consideration is a big deal, in our view United States inflation has peaked, though it remains quite high: In fact; with this publication, we just tweaked our inflation forecast lower for the first time in almost two years See below for more detail, but a 'tug of war between falling housing prices and rising labor costs now better reflects the Fed's intentions to cool the economy: 2 Capital markets new supply (i.e-, new issuance), which we track closely as a proxy for calling bottoms, has dwindled essentially to nothing: In the United States, for example, we measure that it is now approaching the lows we saw in 2009, especially when one adjusts for the growth in GDP since then (Exhibit 1). 3 A more visible hand: We think government spending will quietly surprise on the upside in 2023. Our travels to major political hubs such as Washington DC, Paris, and Tokyo of late lead us to believe that key initiatives like the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA, which we think could be closer to $700 billion versus the 'headline' of $370 billion) and EU Recovery Budget (€1.8 trillion over 2020-2026) will result in more spending than many folks think. Meanwhile, spending on military budgets is increasing around the world, as geopolitics is no longer a discretionary line item in most government budgets these days. Finally, in China, for example, our local research leads us to believe that further stimulus is gaining momentum to offset the headwinds created by recent property developer defaults. The technical picture is actually quite compelling: Many allocators have de-risked their portfolios, especially allocators who likely over-emphasized the stability provided by bonds as we transitioned from QE to QT. We also take comfort that the S&P 500 has already corrected 25%, an important 'lean in' signal based on history, as well as that most High Yield bonds now trade at 85 cents on the dollar, another signal that one should add back some risks to a diversified portfolio. Importantly, our view is that the massive adjustment in the risk-free rate, not necessarily a record widening of credit spreads, will be what is remembered about the opportunity set created during this tightening cycle 5 WWW.KKR.COM INSIGHTS: OUTLOOK FOR 2023: KEEP IT SIMPLE",easyocr
17,kkr_global_view_2023,Unknown,Unknown,4,"and as such, our expectation is that this process takes longer and acts as more of an overhang on liquidity and financial conditions than in prior cycles. We also forecast that short rates do not come down as fast as the consen- suS expects, given that we see inflation being above the Fed's target for at least five years in a row (2021-2025e). So, after what we believe will be a dismal earnings season in January, we think investors should accelerate to at least a jog from a walk in terms of deployment budgeting for 2023 as well as lean more aggressively into the periodic bouts of dislocation we continue to forecast during the next 12-18 months. Simply stated, the recession fears we face in 2023 are likely less ominous and more in the price than the inflation fears that surprised markets in 2022. 5_ We expect to see some unexpected provisioning around Office Real Estate and non-secured consumer lending To be clear , though, we are not advocating a full 'risk-on' in 2023, which could surprise some banks and investors approach like we did after COVID roiled the markets. So, our in the coming quarters. call to arms is not to 'buy the market' with abandon. Rather , it is to be selective within and across asset classes: Key to So, against this backdrop, our most important message our thinking is that: is to keep it simple and buy simplicity. Indeed, as Isaac Newton once said, ""Truth is ever to be found in the 1. Earnings estimates are still too high, and falling unit simplicity, and not in the multiplicity and confusion of volume in recent months will become more apparent as things' We think it is also the time to diversify across inflation cools.

Specifically, we favor shorter duration, bigger companies, and attractive call protection features Further, we also still favor collateral linked to higher nominal GDP growth: 2 Some parts of the market still need to correct: Large cap 'old economy' Technology stocks, for example, are still over-owned by both institutions and individuals. This reality is also occurring at a time of increased competition and regulatory oversight: Looking ahead, we see Technology being less than 20% of the S&P 500 weighting within the next few years, compared to what we think was a peak of 29.1% in 4021. See below for details on our analysis 3 There are still some spicy capital structures, debt in particular, in challenged sectors of the economy that will be tested in the slower growth and higher rate environment If we are right, then Credit makes we envision. Negative operating leverage, 'layering' of old debt with new debt (a product of weak documentation more sense t0 own than Equities during the go-go years), and refinancing risks will all be right now across most asset important issues to sidestep in 2023, we believe. classes.

Weaker global demand could hurt export growth for Europe in 2023 despite a weak euro. Uncertainty around gas supply is the key downside risk to GDP. Further disruption to gas markets (e.g , adverse weather conditions or a complete halting of Russian gas flows) puts GDP and our mild manageable recession forecast at risk. In this scenario, we model a more severe recession lasting into 1024,with a peak to trough fall in GDP of 2.5%. 3 Our bull case is based on the assumption of a gradual relaxation of tension in global energy markets and easing inflation concerns, leading to Eurozone GDP growth in 2023 of 1.5%. 5 We expect labor markets to remain more resilient than in previous crises due to structural tightness in labor supply and consequent reluctance of employers to cut workers.

Mortgage rates at that level would also put more pressure on housing affordability, which is already at a 40-year low (Exhibit 44). In that scenario, we think that homebuyers stepping back from the market would flow through into materially lower home prices and weaker consumer balance sheets, increasing the risk of a more jarring U.S. economic downturn: As such, housing market dynamics imply a 5.125% 'speed limit' for fed funds this cycle, we believe: 2 Because the Fed overtightens in the near-term and is then forced to cut as the housing market deteriorates (our 'Overshoot' case). Both of these risks demand serious consideration, which is why we encourage investors to hedge exposure to higher rates in the near term if possible. Importantly, though, our framework suggests that upside risks to our base case should diminish over time, particularly as the lagged effects of bal- ance sheet policy begin to play out in the real economy. As a result, the term premium on U.S. bonds, which compensates investors for longer-term uncertainty, should diminish, too. On the other hand, we think that the Fed is increasingly concerned about what Chairman Powell called a structural labor shortage' putting sustained downward pressure on U.S. unemployment, as a demographics-driven slowdown limits the number of young people joining the labor force, while the effects of early retirements during COVID continue to impact the availability of older workers. Said differently, it seems likely that U.S. wage growth has experienced a level-shift higher during the pandemic, which means that the Fed will need to hold rates higher for longer to meet its dual mandate of low unemployment and low inflation, in our view. That aligns with our analysis in Exhibit 46, which suggests that the Fed will need to hold rates near five percent through late 2023 in order to bring inflation closer to its two percent target.

We see this as having constructive implications for energy and energy-related equities, which in many cases continue to price at double-digit free cash flow yields that look sustainable as long as oil can hold in the constructive range that we envision: Looking beyond 2023,we think of $80 as being the new' mid-point of the long-term trading range for oil, up from the approximate $50-60 range that generally prevailed in the pre-pandemic era: What has changed, in our view, is that the marginal cost of U.S. shale production which we think remains the key driver of incremental global supply has shifted higher. We see several factors driving this structural shift; including: 1) a higher cost of capital, given uncertainty around how the energy transition will shape regulation and long-term demand; 2) a higher cost of drilling, given scarcities of equipment and labor, and 3) a higher premium placed by the market on firms that return capital versus reinvest it. Looking beyond 2023, we think of s80 as being the 'new' mid-point of the long-term trading range for oil, up from the approximate $50- 60 range that generally prevailed in the pre-pandemic era.

Additionally, after the Fed and other central banks bought up a huge amount of government issuance as part of their pandemic-era QE programs, things are starting to move in reverse, with government securities displacing riskier debt on bank balance sheets.

However, as one can see in Exhibit 89, market bottoms tend to occur when the Fed slows its hawkish campaigns.

From a top-down view, that is a bullish signal, given that valuations tend to bottom out before earnings. However, it also means that we still think this cycle will punish business models that lack defendable margins and a clear ability to pass through higher input costs.

Importantly, we are actually more constructive on both U.S. small-cap and certain non-U.S. stocks relative to the last cycle. Top of mind for us is that small-cap multiples have de-rated much more than large-cap multiples (Russell 2000 P/E is roughly two standard deviations below its long-run average, versus S&P 500 P/E near its long-run average) , while a peak in Fed hawkishness should be a tailwind for foreign-currency assets.

We also see improved lending terms, higher absolute rates, and larger companies. 3 While building this 10% Private Credit allocation (which in general takes a few years) we propose investors pay attention to the current value offered in traded credit: We see some compelling relative value in CLO liabilities for example, which can be used as a bridge to get to the 10% Private Credit allocation: Institutional and individual investors may look for different ways to implement our views. DraW-down funds remain compelling options for institutions and high net worth individuals, but we also see some compelling tactical opportunities across BDCs, interval funds, and even some high quality ETFs. 5 they occur. As numerous studies have shown and as we have witnessed first-hand this year, higher levels of and uncertainty around inflation play a major role in pushing the stock-bond correlation higher. And as we outline in Question #2 above, even though we think that inflation will cool in 2023, we believe that the stock-bond correlation won't return to the levels of the past two decades given the structurally inflationary risks that the pandemic has highlighted. Simply relying on bonds to hedge equity holdings in this new macro regime we envision is a suboptimal stance, in our view. Instead, we believe that investors will need to use more of the tools at their disposal to increase the robustness of their portfolio diversification in the challenging macroeconomic environment ahead (Exhibit 124). So, as we look ahead, we think that long-term investors should not rush back into the 60/40 simply based on performance. Rather , we continue to advocate for some form of a more diversified portfolio, including our 40/30/30 portfolio framework: There are several considerations that we think are worth highlighting to investors. Most importantly, though, is that we maintain high conviction that the traditional stock-bond correlation will remain challenged over the next 5-7 years: Key to our thinking is that we will have a higher resting heart rate for inflation as well as our belief that larger fiscal deficits will persist in developed economies. Finally, we see Quantitative Tightening as a headwind to the role bonds played in portfolios during the last decade or so These insights are hugely important, as the bedrock of the 60/40 allocation is the negative correlation between stocks and bonds, allowing Bonds to cushion Equity losses when WWW.KKR.COM INSIGHTS: OUTLOOK FOR 2023: KEEP IT SIMPLE",easyocr

Truth tends to reveal its highest wisdom in the guise Of simplicity. Friedrich Nietzsche, German philosopher 3 While overall Equity returns are coming down, we think that there is a significant opportunity in small caps. We also like dividend-growing 'aristocratic' equities that have good capital allocators as CEOs Within Private Equity, we believe strongly in companies with simple unit economics and modest leverage. Cash flow conversion, not big TAMs (total addressable markets) will be the key attribute in this new macroeconomic environment we envision. As we peer around the corner to what lies ahead in the global capital markets, we are poised despite some of the significant cross-currents that we see across the global economy to enter 2023 with a more constructive tilt. Our basic premise is that it will be easier to navigate inflation's negative impact on corporate earnings and consumer balance sheets in 2023 than it was to invest with inflation consistently surprising central banks and investors throughout all of 2022. Importantly, though, across all these asset classes, our message is to keep it simple, including moving higher up in the capital structure when possible, not over-extending on duration, and focusing on quality. Consistent with this view, we think the reality that many banks are no longer extending credit as freely means that it is a good time to fill that gap and be a lender to high quality counterparties And within Credit, the good news is that all the dislocations that occurred in 2022 have now created a large number of cost of capital arbitrages that favor investors who understand relative value. However , making money in 2023 and beyond will not be easy. It will require both patience and courage , and it will require an investor to have a game plan that leverages the type of long-term frameworks that we employ at KKR across asset classes and regions. In terms of deployment preferences, our message is straightforward: Keep It Simple: We have exited TINA (there is no alternative), and as such, one does not need to stretch to make an adequate total return: In terms of where we would lean in, we favor a few things: In today's market we heavily fa- 1.

Importantly, we believe that it will be the marriage of a steady, top down framework coupled with sound bottom-up fundamental analysis that will win the day.

Certain high-volatility investments can be subject to sudden and large falls in value that could equal the amount invested: Important Disclosure on High Yield Bonds Unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities typically offer a higher yield than investment grade Debt Securities, but also present greater risks with respect to liquidity, volatility , and non-payment of principal and interest: As a result of being classified as non investment grade Debt Securities, these Debt Securities present a greater degree of credit risk relative to many other fixed income Debt Securities_ Higher Credit Risk Unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities generally have predominantly speculative characteristics with respect to the issuer's capacity to pay interest and repay principal_ There is greater risk of non-payment of interest and loss of principal. Many issuers of these Debt Securities have experienced substantial difficulties in servicing their debt obligations, which has led to default and restructurings. The issuers of these Debt Securities generally have to pay a higher rate of interest than investment grade Debt Securities. Higher Liquidity and Secondary Market Risk _ The markets in which unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities are traded are generally more limited than those in which investment grade Debt Securities are traded: This lack of liquidity may make it more difficult to resell these Debt Securities and obtain market quotations Downgrade Risk Downgrades in the credit rating of unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities by rating agencies are generally accompanied by declines in the market value of these Debt Securities. In some circumstances, investors in the unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities market may anticipate such downgrades as a result of these credits being placed on ""credit watch"" by rating agencies, causing volatility and speculation of further credit deterioration. Higher Vulnerability to economic cycles During economic downturns, unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities are typically more susceptible to price volatility and fall more in value than investment grade Debt Securities as i) investors may reevaluate holdings in lower-quality bonds in favor of investment-grade corporate Debt Securities; ii) investors become more risk averse; and iii) default risk rises_ This is often referred to a ""flight to quality' Event Risk This includes any of a variety of events that can adversely affect the issuer of unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities, and therefore the issuer's ability to meet debt service obligations to repay principal and interest to Debt Securities holders. Event risk may pertain to the issuer specifically, the industry or business sector of the issuer, or generally upon the overall economy: It could have a direct or indirect impact on the issuer and their outstanding debts. Important Disclosure on RMB Risk relating to RMB _ If you choose RMB as the base currency or the alternate currency, you should also note the following: RMB is currently not freely convertible through banks in Hong Kong Due to exchange controls andlor restrictions imposed on the convertibility, utilization or transferability of RMB (if any) which in turn is affected by, amongst other things, the PRC government's control, there is no guarantee that disruption in the transferability, convertibility or liquidity of RMB will not occur: There is thus a likelihood that you may not be able to convert RMB received into other freely convertible currencies CNH exchange rates and CNY exchange rates are currently quoted in different markets with different exchange rates, whereby their exchange rate movements may not be in the same direction or magnitude. Therefore, the CNH exchange rate may be different from the CNY exchange rate_ citi",easyocr
