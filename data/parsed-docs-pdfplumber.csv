Important Disclosure on High Yield Bonds
Unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities typically offer a higher yield than investment grade Debt Securities, but also present greater risks with respect to liquidity, volatility,
and non-payment of principal and interest. As a result of being classified as non investment grade Debt Securities, these Debt Securities present a greater degree of credit risk
relative to many other fixed income Debt Securities.
Higher Credit Risk –Unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities generally have predominantly speculative characteristics with respect to the issuer’s capacity to pay interest
and repay principal. There is greater risk of non-payment of interest and loss of principal. Many issuers of these Debt Securities have experienced substantial difficulties in servicing
their debt obligations, which has led to default and restructurings. The issuers of these Debt Securities generally have to pay a higher rate of interest than investment grade Debt
Securities.
Higher Liquidity and Secondary Market Risk –The markets in which unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities are traded aregenerally more limited than those in which
investment grade Debt Securities are traded. This lack of liquidity may make it more difficult to resell these Debt Securities and obtain market quotations.
Downgrade Risk –Downgrades in the credit rating of unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities by rating agencies are generally accompanied by declines in the market value
of these Debt Securities. In some circumstances, investors in the unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities market may anticipate such downgrades as a result of these
credits being placed on “credit watch” by rating agencies, causing volatility and speculation of further credit deterioration.
Higher Vulnerability to economic cycles -During economic downturns, unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities are typically more susceptible to price volatility and fall more
in value than investment grade Debt Securities as i) investors may reevaluate holdings in lower-quality bonds in favor of investment-grade corporate Debt Securities; ii) investors
become more risk averse; and iii) default risk rises. This is often referred to a “flight to quality”.
Event Risk –This includes any of a variety of events that can adversely affect the issuer of unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities, and therefore the issuer’s ability to meet
debt service obligations to repay principal and interest to Debt Securities holders. Event risk may pertain to the issuer specifically, the industry or business sector of the issuer, or
generally upon the overall economy. It could have a direct or indirect impact on the issuer and their outstanding debts.
Important Disclosure on RMB
Risk relating to RMB –If you choose RMB as the base currency or the alternate currency, you should also note the following:
RMB is currently not freely convertible through banks in Hong Kong. Due to exchange controls and/or restrictions imposed on the convertibility, utilization or transferability of RMB (if
any) which in turn is affected by, amongst other things, the PRC government's control, there is no guarantee that disruption in the transferability, convertibility or liquidity of RMB will
not occur. There is thus a likelihood that you may not be able to convert RMB received into other freely convertible currencies.
CNH exchange rates and CNY exchange rates are currently quoted in different markets with different exchange rates, whereby theirexchange rate movements may not be in the
same direction or magnitude. Therefore, the CNH exchange rate may be different from the CNY exchange rate.",pdfplumber

Index Benchmarks
Indices are unmanaged. The figures for the index reflect the reinvestment of all income or
dividends, as applicable, but do not reflect the deduction of any fees or expenses which
would reduce returns. Investors cannot invest directly in indices.
The indices referenced herein have been selected because they are well known, easily
recognized by investors, and reflect those indices that the Investment Manager believes, in
part based on industry practice, provide a suitable benchmark against which to evaluate
the investment or broader market described herein. The exclusion of “failed” or closed
hedge funds may mean that each index overstates the performance of hedge funds
generally.

Important Disclosure on High Yield Bonds
Unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities typically offer a higher yield than investment grade Debt Securities, but also present greater risks with respect to liquidity, volatility,
and non-payment of principal and interest. As a result of being classified as non investment grade Debt Securities, these Debt Securities present a greater degree of credit risk
relative to many other fixed income Debt Securities.
Higher Credit Risk –Unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities generally have predominantly speculative characteristics with respect to the issuer’s capacity to pay interest
and repay principal. There is greater risk of non-payment of interest and loss of principal. Many issuers of these Debt Securities have experienced substantial difficulties in servicing
their debt obligations, which has led to default and restructurings. The issuers of these Debt Securities generally have to pay a higher rate of interest than investment grade Debt
Securities.
Higher Liquidity and Secondary Market Risk –The markets in which unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities are traded aregenerally more limited than those in which
investment grade Debt Securities are traded. This lack of liquidity may make it more difficult to resell these Debt Securities and obtain market quotations.
Downgrade Risk –Downgrades in the credit rating of unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities by rating agencies are generally accompanied by declines in the market value
of these Debt Securities. In some circumstances, investors in the unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities market may anticipate such downgrades as a result of these
credits being placed on “credit watch” by rating agencies, causing volatility and speculation of further credit deterioration.
Higher Vulnerability to economic cycles -During economic downturns, unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities are typically more susceptible to price volatility and fall more
in value than investment grade Debt Securities as i) investors may reevaluate holdings in lower-quality bonds in favor of investment-grade corporate Debt Securities; ii) investors
become more risk averse; and iii) default risk rises. This is often referred to a “flight to quality”.
Event Risk –This includes any of a variety of events that can adversely affect the issuer of unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities, and therefore the issuer’s ability to meet
debt service obligations to repay principal and interest to Debt Securities holders. Event risk may pertain to the issuer specifically, the industry or business sector of the issuer, or
generally upon the overall economy. It could have a direct or indirect impact on the issuer and their outstanding debts.
Important Disclosure on RMB
Risk relating to RMB –If you choose RMB as the base currency or the alternate currency, you should also note the following:
RMB is currently not freely convertible through banks in Hong Kong. Due to exchange controls and/or restrictions imposed on the convertibility, utilization or transferability of RMB (if
any) which in turn is affected by, amongst other things, the PRC government's control, there is no guarantee that disruption in the transferability, convertibility or liquidity of RMB will
not occur. There is thus a likelihood that you may not be able to convert RMB received into other freely convertible currencies.
CNH exchange rates and CNY exchange rates are currently quoted in different markets with different exchange rates, whereby theirexchange rate movements may not be in the
same direction or magnitude. Therefore, the CNH exchange rate may be different from the CNY exchange rate.",pdfplumber

Important Disclosure on High Yield Bonds
Unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities typically offer a higher yield than investment grade Debt Securities, but also present greater risks with respect to liquidity,
volatility, and non-payment of principal and interest. As a result of being classified as non investment grade Debt Securities, these Debt Securities present a greater degree of
credit risk relative to many other fixed income Debt Securities.
Higher Credit Risk –Unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities generally have predominantly speculative characteristics with respect to the issuer’s capacity to pay
interest and repay principal. There is greater risk of non-payment of interest and loss of principal. Many issuers of these DebtSecurities have experienced substantial difficulties
in servicing their debt obligations, which has led to default and restructurings. The issuers of these Debt Securities generallyhave to pay a higher rate of interest than
investment grade Debt Securities.
Higher Liquidity and Secondary Market Risk –The markets in which unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities are traded aregenerally more limited than those in which
investment grade Debt Securities are traded. This lack of liquidity may make it more difficult to resell these Debt Securities and obtain market quotations.
Downgrade Risk –Downgrades in the credit rating of unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities by rating agencies are generally accompanied by declines in the market
value of these Debt Securities. In some circumstances, investors in the unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities market may anticipate such downgrades as a result of
these credits being placed on “credit watch” by rating agencies, causing volatility and speculation of further credit deterioration.
Higher Vulnerability to economic cycles -During economic downturns, unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities are typically more susceptible to price volatility and fall
more in value than investment grade Debt Securities as i) investors may reevaluate holdings in lower-quality bonds in favor of investment-grade corporate Debt Securities; ii)
investors become more risk averse; and iii) default risk rises. This is often referred to a “flight to quality”.
Event Risk –This includes any of a variety of events that can adversely affect the issuer of unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities, and therefore the issuer’s ability to
meet debt service obligations to repay principal and interest to Debt Securities holders. Event risk may pertain to the issuer specifically, the industry or business sector of the
issuer, or generally upon the overall economy. It could have a direct or indirect impact on the issuer and their outstanding debts.
Important Disclosure on RMB
Risk relating to RMB –If you choose RMB as the base currency or the alternate currency, you should also note the following:
RMB is currently not freely convertible through banks in Hong Kong. Due to exchange controls and/or restrictions imposed on the convertibility, utilization or transferability of
RMB (if any) which in turn is affected by, amongst other things, the PRC government's control, there is no guarantee that disruption in the transferability, convertibility or
liquidity of RMB will not occur. There is thus a likelihood that you may not be able to convert RMB received into other freely convertible currencies.
CNH exchange rates and CNY exchange rates are currently quoted in different markets with different exchange rates, whereby theirexchange rate movements may not be in the
same direction or magnitude. Therefore, the CNH exchange rate may be different from the CNY exchange rate.",pdfplumber

Global head of investments
Letter to investors
We have become accustomed to uncertain times. Nonetheless, 2022 was an extremely
challenging year in financial markets. The investment rationale for the classic 60%
stocks / 40% bonds portfolio is that it will deliver solid if not spectacular returns. As
of October, the 60/40 portfolio was on track to match its worst year for performance
since the Second World War.
Sharply rising bond yields were a key reason. They weighed on ultra-long duration
assets like equities, with the Nasdaq down almost 30% year-to-date. Beyond 60/40,
we saw major rotations in style with value stocks bucking the trend of recent years
and outperforming growth. In currency markets, the US dollar surged and the
Japanese yen had a year to forget.
Navigating geopolitical tensions has increasingly become an occupational hazard for
investors. The conflict in Ukraine has had a profound impact on global commodity
prices, amplifying inflation, and forcing Europe to re-think its energy policies. This
will have major implications for industry structure and living standards for years
to come. Meanwhile, markets are watching Sino-US relations closely, fearful that
tensions over Taiwan could escalate.
No doubt 2023 will bring fresh sources of volatility. But that volatility should be seen
as an opportunity for an active manager. It is our job to make sense of the evolving
macroeconomic landscape, position accordingly, and translate the market moves
into strong performance for our clients. We remain convinced that a relentless
focus on sustainability is an essential ingredient within that investment process and
we do not accept that there is a conflict between delivering strong performance
for clients and embedding sustainability in everything we do. On the contrary, we
view sustainable investing as an opportunity, rather than a constraint. We have just
published Committed to climate: Our net zero roadmap which spells out how we will
align our portfolios with the goal of reaching net zero emissions. I hope that you will
remain partners with us on the journey to net zero investing.",pdfplumber

Executive summary
In our 2023 Investment Outlook, we seek to guide investors at a pivotal moment for
the global economy. We live in an age of transformation, with surging inflation and
fundamental geopolitical shifts leading to rising demands on governments.
A sustainable recovery
In the terms of the progressing green transformation, we believe that, as investors,
we must continue to focus our resources on sustainable long-term growth. We see
opportunities in the shift leading to, for example, green hydrogen, restoring natural
capital or building green infrastructure.
Investment themes for the long run
Our themes have both a sustainable angle – energy transition and environmental
sustainability – and a focus on enduring trends. These trends include innovation and
disruption via new technology, the appeal of private markets and the emergence
of China. While any significant re-rating of China A-shares may be unlikely now,
valuations appear attractive and argue for strategic positioning. Opportunities
include consumption upgrading and hard-tech development.
Macroeconomics and markets
These sections highlight that:
• The global economy is on the brink of recession as policy rates shoot higher,
Europe faces an energy shock, and China struggles with zero-Covid policies and
fragile property markets.
• The Chinese government has scope to stimulate growth, but in the West,
government measures to aid households and companies may undermine central
bank inflation-busting.
• Equities face a struggle to generate above-average returns, even as the disconnect
between still relatively optimistic corporate earnings expectations and economic
reality narrows. We are neutral, with deep caution in Europe offset by optimism
for US growth stocks.
• Within fixed income, eurozone investment-grade credit offers the most attractive
opportunity with wide spreads, but generally good corporate fundamentals.",pdfplumber

MACRO OUTLOOK
DANIEL MORRIS
Chief market strategist
The recession march
The global economy seems on an inevitable march towards recession. The causes
are well-known: central banks aggressively raising policy rates to reduce inflation,
an energy shock in Europe, and zero-Covid policies (ZCP) and a shaky property
market in China.
Much of Europe is already in recession. We expect one to begin in the US in the third
quarter of 2023, and while China’s growth will likely not turn negative, it will be
below historic levels.
One can easily think of ways in which the situation could yet worsen: a breakdown
in a key financial market due to the rapid rise in interest rates, a cold winter and
blackouts in Europe, or a flare-up in geopolitical tensions between the US and China.
US
Given the strength of the US labour market, reflected not only in a low unemployment
rate, but also in high (nominal) wage gains, declines in non-farm payrolls in 2023
will likely be necessary. Consumer demand will weaken, even though households
still have a large amount of ‘excess’ savings. These savings are falling and, we should
note, are concentrated among high-income/low-consumption households.
A deterioration of the labour market will be key to bringing services inflation under
control. Goods inflation should drop thanks to base effects and lower demand, while",pdfplumber
4,bnp_parisbas_global_view_2023,Unknown,Unknown,6,"INVESTMENT OUTLOOK FOR 2023 - 7 -
shelter costs will eventually reflect the ongoing slowdown in the housing market. We
anticipate core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation will fall below 3%
by the end of 2023.
One open question is whether wage inflation can be reduced without a large increase
in unemployment. The number of job vacancies relative to the size of the labour
force is still about twice the long-run average1, meaning companies are forced to
raise wages to attract workers (see Exhibit 1). Historically, vacancies only decline
significantly when the unemployment rate rises. The US Federal Reserve believes
that the currently high number of vacancies reflects the reorganisation of the labour
market and the economy following the pandemic. As that process ends, vacancies
could fall without the unemployment rate necessarily rising.
There is another reason to believe the unemployment rate may not rise very much.
US companies have learned from the lockdown recession that firing employees may
reduce costs in the short term, but it creates problems later on. They may move
towards a more European model, where employees are kept on the payroll through
a recession, allowing for a swifter and smoother recovery later.
Offsetting the drag from higher policy rates will be the ongoing investments triggered
by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, and the Inflation Reduction Act, which
will direct nearly USD 400 billion in tax credits and subsidies for numerous clean
energy programmes.

Eurozone
Europe is facing an energy shock unlike anything the region has seen since the OPEC
price increases in the 1970s (see Exhibit 2). Even though gas prices have moderated
of late, they are still 10 times higher than the average in 2019.
Inflation is in double digits in some countries, consumer sentiment has collapsed,
and demand is weakening along with disposable income. Nonetheless, we believe
headline inflation has peaked and will return to the ECB’s 2% target in 2024.
The response of governments to economic shocks has changed since the pandemic.
Instead of counting on automatic stabilisers such as unemployment insurance to
tide households through the downturn, governments have resorted to more direct
support to mitigate any decline in income (or corporate profits).
This strategy was comparatively easy during the pandemic as policy rates and
inflation were low and central banks were purchasing government debt. The recent
experience of the UK, however, shows the limits of these policies now that inflation
is well above target and central banks are looking to reduce the size of their balance
sheets. While Germany can afford a EUR 200 billion support package, other countries
may not. When Italian government bond yields were above 4% prior to the global
financial crisis, the country’s debt was a few percentage points less than its GDP. It is
now 40% greater. In 2022, debt-GDP ratios nonetheless improved, but in 2023, they
will likely see a deterioration. Governments will need to ensure further expenditure
is targeted to avoid a countervailing response to any stimulus from the ECB.
The EUR 2 trillion NextGenerationEU recovery plan (the largest EU stimulus package
ever) will be key to creating a “greener, more digital and more resilient Europe”.

China
The two factors that were dragging on Chinese growth in 2022 — its zero-Covid
policies and an unsteady property market — should moderate in 2023, allowing the
economy to rebound, though growth will likely remain below pre-pandemic levels.
Covid infections in China have spiked again. Nevertheless, the government has
reiterated its commitment to ZCP. At the same time, work on an mRNA vaccine is
progressing and it should eventually be rolled out. We now know from experience
that economic activity can rebound quickly once restrictions are lifted.
The problems in the property market will likely take longer to address. The recent
Communist Party Congress signalled there would be longer-term policies to develop
a housing system that ensures supply from multiple sources and the development of
both rental and property sales markets. In the near term, the government is looking
to targeted policies to support the recovery of the sector.
President Xi’s Party Congress speech was also notable for its emphasis on speeding
up the transition to green development and meeting carbon emissions goals. This
should be another source of long-term demand for companies in the relevant
industries.
A key distinction between China and the US and Europe is the scope the government
has to stimulate the economy, through either fiscal or monetary measures. While
core inflation is at over 4% in the eurozone and over 6% in the US, in China, it is at
just 0.4% (see Exhibit 3).2

MARKETS OUTLOOK
MAYA BHANDARI
Global head of multi-asset
Taking stock
2022 has been an extraordinary year, marking the end of an extraordinary decade and
a half since the Global Financial Crisis (GFC). A sharp and swift rise in real discount
rates caused bruising losses across asset classes, ending the panacea that ‘lower for
longer’ interest rates delivered for risky assets over many decades. For example, an
investor in a portfolio of 60% global equities and 40% government bonds had lost an
eye-watering 20% by late October. That is a far cry from the 9-10% she or he would
have grown accustomed to making over the last 50-odd years. These losses were the
steepest incurred in a generation – including 2008, which saw losses of ‘just’ 14%.
We, as others, had seen this steep rise in real yields as the chief risk facing financial
markets in 2022. Our multi-asset portfolios were short duration, neutral equities
(through a combination of long Asia and short Europe), and long commodities for much
of 2022. Yet, as sovereign bond yields, particularly real yields, quickly approached
post-GFC highs, we took profits on our long-standing short in government bonds.
One of the biggest questions for 2023 is how soon central banks will pause, or even
reverse, their discount rate increases and what impact this will have on the value of
cash flows across asset classes. Certainly in 2022, the bulk of asset market moves
can be explained by changes in the discount rate.
We are now turning more constructive on corporate credit, particularly higher-
grade credit in Europe. Here, we believe low valuations (that is, high spreads), do",pdfplumber
4,bnp_parisbas_global_view_2023,Unknown,Unknown,10,"INVESTMENT OUTLOOK FOR 2023 -11 -
not accurately reflect what we believe are favourable fundamentals. We are not
yet ready to add more broadly to riskier assets such as equities. We are still
concerned over greater downside to both growth and earnings, and continued
geopolitical uncertainty could weigh further on cash flow projections. At the same
time, we acknowledge that areas including long-duration US tech companies are
starting to look interesting as 2022 draws to a close.
Every risk has its price
There are usually a handful of key judgements upon which one’s investment
views ultimately rest. Today, there are three particular questions that matter
enormously for return prospects in 2023.
1. When will the US Federal Reserve and other major central banks pivot towards
lowering policy rates?
2. How deep will the growth and earnings correction be?
3. (The biggest unknown) How great will geopolitical disruption from China, Russia-
Ukraine, the US, and Europe (including the UK) be in 2023?
The Fed has so far delivered the sharpest speed
of policy tightening ever
The Fed has so far delivered the sharpest speed of policy tightening ever delivered.
When will they pause and to allow effects of the increases to work their way through
the system, avoiding the policy error of pushing on the brakes too hard? On balance,
our judgment is that the odds of a quicker, sharper policy pivot are mounting, and
prospectively quite fast.

Interest rates, both real and nominal, both current and implied, increased
dramatically in major economies in 2022. While the increase occurred across the
curve, it was particularly sharp at the short end. The 500bp rise in 2-year real rates
since March was has been remarkable, as was the move in the expected level of
fed funds in three years from 1.5% to 5% in just six months. Five-year real rates
(measured five years ahead), that many view as a long-term guide for ‘neutral’ policy
rates, have soared from 50-year to levels last seen prior to the GFC. They stood at
just -85bp in the US and -1.4% in Europe a year ago, whereas at the time of writing
they were 1.50% and 1.25%, respectively. There are good reasons for those levels,
including a significant shift in the fiscal-monetary mix, a turn in structural trends
such as globalisation that had preserved the downtrend in government bonds, and
favourable demographics. But there are good reasons, too, for them to pause for
breath, with mounting headwinds for both inflation and growth.
Persistently high inflation has tested
central bank credibility
Persistently high inflation has tested central bank credibility, forcing them to set
interest rates in the ‘rear view mirror’. But effective policy rates are now priced to
reach a fairly restrictive 5.0-5.5% in the US1 and 2.25% in Europe by mid-2023, just
as growth and inflation weaken from the tightening already feeding through the
system. We believe a pause in the rate hikes (which have been the dominant driver
of weakness in asset prices in 2022), could offer some respite for risk assets. The
question is how much.

Staying long high-quality European corporate credit at fairly distressed valuations is
one area that continues to look compelling to us. At the time of writing, spreads are
at 2020 crisis levels for the best-rated European corporates, with an implied default
rate of around 10%. That is more than twice the worst five-year rate and eight times
the average. Furthermore, and unusually at this point in the cycle, leverage ratios at
these companies are contained and falling, interest coverage is high and corporate
balance sheets are firm. The pressure then on companies to de-lever, which is what
tends to dent credit as economic cycles weaken, is conspicuously absent this time
as companies enter a potential recession long cash and with longer duration debt.
Our judgement here is cautious on what it means
for earnings, or equity cash flows
This leads neatly to the second question raised above: the depth of the coming growth
correction, and the state of household balance sheets, as 2022 draws to a close
with double-digit inflation. This environment makes us more cautious, particularly
as far as earnings are concerned. Consequently, we are leaning away from investing
in assets lower down the capital structure, especially equities, in more challenged
areas such as Europe.
Our economics team expects the US to lose three million jobs early in 2023, with
payrolls falling by 300 000 or more. The housing market is expected to continue
weakening. We see mortgage rates nearly 400bp higher than in the summer of 2021
and mortgage applications falling steeply. Europe’s economic outlook is similarly
poor, with greater downside risks from the war in Ukraine and the energy crisis, and
households with a smaller savings buffer. We know from the GFC the impact of a

wilting housing market on growth, and we are now having the additional impact of
sticky and rising housing rents on services inflation. This increasingly fragile
macroeconomic environment seems profoundly disconnected with relatively
optimistic corporate earnings expectations. As a result we are neutral on equities, but
with a deeply cautious view on Europe balanced by more optimism towards China
and Japan. While equites delivered double-digit total return losses in 2022, and
valuations cheapened from January 2022’s lofty highs, losses would have been
steeper were it not for expectations of positive earnings growth for 2022 and 2023.
This increasingly fragile macroeconomic
environment seems profoundly disconnected
Earnings expectations are at best a coincident indicator, but they are too high for the
macroeconomic setting just described. We have several frameworks for thinking about
where earnings and valuations should be at different points in the cycle. With the
exception of Asia and, more recently the US Nasdaq index, our research points to further
falls to come — from both lower valuations and earnings — before we reach fair value.
Lastly, geopolitical risks pepper the investment horizon. This is something we will
monitor closely in 2023. The evolution of the Ukraine war and the energy crisis;
China’s approach to Taiwan and the reopening of its economy; trade wars and their
impact on supply chains – each of these developments could alter the path of both
cash flows and discount rates. With no quick resolution in sight, risks here are likely
to remain elevated.

Focus on fixed income - A new bond world
Fixed income bonds saw unprecedentedly poor returns in 2022, with all key sectors
posting a negative performance (as at 10 November 2022) due to a normalisation
of policy rates, recession hurting credit spreads, and liquidity shocks driving up
volatility. After a more than 50-year bull market, a new bond world has emerged in
which it is now possible to earn a positive absolute performance.
Central banks have managed to drive interest rates to normalised levels, meaning
rates should not need to rise meaningfully from here. Five year-five year real yields
in the US and the eurozone have returned to their post-Global Financial Crisis highs.
Consequently, carry will be essential in generating returns in the future. Investors
should recall that historically, carry accounts for the bulk of fixed income total
returns. The transition to the new world is not complete, however, meaning volatility
will likely remain high and asset allocation is crucial. 2023 will see both growth and
inflation decelerate and accelerate, calling for different allocations depending on the
macroeconomic regime.
Any return to fixed income should focus on core assets such as money market
instruments, government bonds and investment-grade credit, alongside diversifying
satellite investments in flexible bonds, green bonds and emerging market debt.
Investing back in money markets is attractive as they offer visibility thanks to short
duration, and now attractive yields given the substantial rise in short-term rates. We
could see declines in US policy rates by the end of 2023, though this is less likely in
the eurozone.
We believe eurozone investment-grade credit is attractive as spreads at the time
of writing are commensurate with much higher default rates than we think will
actually materialise.

SUSTAINABILITY
JANE AMBACHTSHEER ALEXANDER BERNHARDT
Global head of sustainability Global head of sustainability research
The evolution of sustainable finance
In early 2005, United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan invited a group of the
world’s largest institutional investors to help develop the Principles for Responsible
Investment (PRI). Only a few years later, the excesses of a lightly regulated financial
system would spark a global economic crisis while undermining many of the
financial models used till then. In retrospect, this was an appropriate time for
finance to begin to wake up to some of the excesses of corporate behaviour it was
enabling. Since then, we have seen a ten-fold increase in sustainable investment
related regulations. Here, we explore this evolution and the path that lies ahead.
The great financial crisis raised important questions about the role of finance.
The industry has long interpreted its fiduciary duty to clients as a requirement to
‘maximise’ financial returns for ‘beneficiaries’, most often on a horizon of quarters
or years.
Since 2005, the industry has rigorously debated the impact of integrating
environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria into this duty. The discussion
has been buffeted by parallel debates over the timeframe across which return
maximisation should be sought and for which beneficiaries.
In 2005, the research basis for understanding the financial impact of ESG
considerations was relatively thin. Since then, our understanding of this topic has
grown massively.",pdfplumber

There is much to do to realise ESG integration with
proper strength and accuracy across portfolios
ESG factors and investment outcomes
What we can now say with some certainty is that ESG integration – at corporate and
fund levels – more often than not leads to better financial outcomes. Thanks largely
to the efforts of the PRI and other industry groups, the fiduciary duty debate has
largely been put to bed. Investors controlling more than USD 100 trillion in assets
have agreed at the highest levels to this preface to the PRI’s six principles:
“As institutional investors, we have a duty to act in the best long-term interests
of our beneficiaries. In this fiduciary role, we believe that environmental, social,
and corporate governance (ESG) issues can affect the performance of investment
portfolios (to varying degrees across companies, sectors, regions, asset classes
and through time). We also recognise that applying these Principles may better
align investors with broader objectives of society.”
While the investment industry agrees in principle, much remains to be done to
realise ESG integration with proper strength and accuracy across portfolios. The
gap between ambition and actuality underlies much of the recent criticism of ESG
(namely greenwashing) revolving around misleading claims by some investors
and the messiness of ESG data. Regulators have stepped up their efforts to create
clarity on the definition and application of ‘sustainability’. Sustainable investment
regulations have grown globally from below 50 in 2015 to more than 500.1
Tackling ESG criticism
Here, we explore some of the criticisms. Often, they go too far and warrant a closer
look on the basis of the following:
• ESG has been an attention grabber, not a distraction. ESG integration efforts have
highlighted issues such as climate risk and diversity. This has likely accelerated
corporate and policy action rather than distracted from them.
• What’s your counterfactual? Admittedly, many environmental and social
indicators have worsened over the past 20 years. But would the environment and
society be better off if the investment industry had ignored ESG as was largely the
case before 2004? That is unlikely.
• ESG is just data. At the most basic level, ESG indicators convey dispassionate
information about company management that can materially impact results. True,
the data is often sparsely disclosed, rarely audited and diversely interpreted. For
thoughtful investors, properly analysed data can convey important and tradable
information which can lead to outperformance.

• Fees aren’t the issue. Some critics say the industry uses ESG as an excuse to
charge more. While this may be the case for some passive funds and their
ESG equivalents, the data does not support this claim for the bulk of actively
managed ESG funds. For the most part, ESG funds are priced similarly to
equivalent standard funds.
• ESG is more than just emissions. While climate change can be seen as the most
important global systemic risk, it is not the only one. For instance, if we succeed
in cutting emissions, but exacerbate inequality, we will be trading one systemic
risk for another.
The ability to generate sustainable returns relies
on a healthy planet and population
Necessary step to sustainable finance
Before ESG, there was Socially Responsible Investing. SRI was dedicated to the
creation of a just and sustainable economic system. With the advent of the PRI,
the focus shifted to ESG factors. This stripped away notions of responsibility and
irresponsibility to focus on the bottom line and the financial risks and rewards of
accounting for these factors.
The success of the ESG movement has set the table for broader discussions on the
future of sustainable finance. We are coming full circle, moving away from a pure
financial focus on integrating ESG factors towards recognising that investors have
real impact on the world – and that their ability to generate sustainable returns relies
on a healthy planet and population. More than 270 asset managers with some USD
61 trillion in assets under management have now committed to net zero portfolio
emissions by 2050 by signing the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative.2
Without the efforts of the PRI and other industry groups, we would not now see ESG
issues on the agendas in most boardrooms and policy action being taken to address
ESG transparency and encourage investment in sustainability solutions.
We also see that the world has not made the required progress towards a low-
carbon, environmentally sustainable and inclusive economy that we collectively
require to ensure long-term returns. This means there is more to do. The
astounding growth of the ‘ESG industry’ has forced a long overdue discussion on
the intersection between societal well-being and investment. What was old is new
again, and hopefully, just in time.

History can help assess the future
Understanding the drivers of past industrial revolutions can be invaluable when
assessing long-term investment opportunities such as those presented by the
effects of climate change and the current energy crisis. What the lessons can
investors draw from economic history?
Even amid the headwinds from crises such as the food and energy supply stress and
extreme climate phenomena, the world is on the cusp of a new industrial revolution
–one that could allow capacity – and resources – to be used more efficiently and
lead to a greener and more sustainable future.
‘Industry 4.0’ – involving such advances as the smart factory, autonomous systems,
3D printing and machine learning – promises to provide us with the tools for a
replenished biosphere, greater energy and food security, and improved living
standards and job opportunities.
It also looks set to usher in a sharing economy involving ‘open source’ approaches
to information and innovation which can accelerate change including the energy
transition. A practical example: in such a setting, people will more rarely own cars;
they will simply hire a (probably autonomous electric) vehicle when they need to.",pdfplumber

The road to industry 4.0
Such progress needs massive investment. However, assessing which will be the
long-term winners and avoiding the short-term ‘fads’ can be a challenge. A look at
previous revolutions can help.
The original industrial revolution, in England between 1760 and 1860, was driven by
technological progress, education, and a growing capital stock. It turned the country
into ‘the workshop of the world’ and brought about a sustained rise in real income
per head.
The second industrial revolution, in the US from the 1850s, was driven by factors
such as electrification, crude oil production, the rapid spread of telephony, and
assembly-line vehicle production. These helped ignite the country’s ascent to a
global superpower.
By the early 2000s, the productivity potential of the infrastructure upon which the
second industrial revolution was built had become exhausted. A new technological
infrastructure emerged, driven by computers, IT networks and robotics. These sowed
the seeds of Industry 4.0.
This latest revolution could be transformative,
for economies, the environment, and the way
societies are organised

of producing and delivering more and more goods and services to near zero (or a
marginal amount).
Over the next decade, Industry 4.0 infrastructure looks set to expand to include,
for example, self-driving cars using cheap renewable energy on smart transport
‘internets’. This should allow people to share mobility, but also communication and
energy.
Identifying themes and winners
How can we identify those companies that can survive and prosper for the next 10
to 20 years?
In our view, history has shown that the rate of technological change and cost
declines have often surpassed projections. Just look at the share of electricity from
renewable sources in total US power generation. Environmental solutions such as
green hydrogen, solar energy or bio-plastics are disrupting manufacturing and supply
chains and transforming global consumer behaviour.
Understanding this accelerating consumption
transformation helps to inform
our investment decisions
Understanding this accelerating transformation – and, importantly, its impact on
the industries affected by it – helps to inform our investment decisions. We seek to
benefit from the penetration of transformative technologies, the growth rates that
this advance brings for industries and companies, and what this means for their
lifecycles.
Finding winners takes research, an open mind, and the ability to examine challenges
and opportunities from multiple perspectives. It also means having the conviction to
strictly target positive environmental outcomes.
What is required is a wider understanding of the breadth – and, crucially, the inter-
relatedness – of the challenges that, for example, the energy crisis presents and
the opportunities it creates, such as an accelerated transition to renewable, locally
produced sources of energy.
A thorough understanding of previous and current periods of disruption can help
us identify the potential investment winners of the coming new carbon-free age.
And we are convinced that active investment management is the key to identifying
companies that can outperform.",pdfplumber

DISRUPTIVE TECH
PAM HEGARTY VINCENT NICHOLS
Portfolio manager Investment specialist
Secular growth drivers dominate
The outlook for the technology sector in 2023 is difficult to assess, given the
significant macroeconomic and geopolitical headwinds. However, we remain
confident in the durability of the secular growth drivers that underpin our strategy
–cloud computing, artificial intelligence, automation, and the Internet of Things –
as well as the foundational technologies that enable these themes. We believe that
the leaders and beneficiaries of digital transformation will deliver superior revenue
growth, earnings, cash flows, and returns over a long-term investment horizon.
During most of 2022, the tech sector underperformed the broader market as interest
rates rose. As a result, valuations have compressed, with little to no ‘froth’ left today,
especially in the semiconductor and software industries.
While negative earnings revisions are likely as the economy slows, we see potential
for the sector to outperform on a relative basis, given the historical resilience of tech
profits during recessions. As growth becomes scarcer, investors may once again be
willing to pay up for quality growth.
Opportunities as we head into 2023
1. The adoption of cloud computing, artificial intelligence (AI), automation, and the
Internet of Things continue as companies strive to save costs and make better
decisions.
2. The strategic importance of the digital transformation should provide resiliency to",pdfplumber
4,bnp_parisbas_global_view_2023,Unknown,Unknown,22,"INVESTMENT OUTLOOK FOR 2023 -23 -
corporate spending on information technology (IT). Gartner forecasts 5% growth
in IT spending in 2023. Cybersecurity is one area that we expect to hold up well.
3. Semiconductor demand may prove resilient in end-markets including automotive
(where electronic content is increasing and inventories remain low) and datacentre
(depending on the resiliency of spending to support cloud and AI initiatives).
4. Valuations look compelling. We estimate the average enterprise value to next-
twelve-month estimated sales ratio for North American software stocks to be
nearly back to 6x. That is close to the 2013-2018 level and 32% below the most
recent five-year average (see Exhibit 1).
5. Most semiconductor stocks are trading near (or below) our worst-case scenarios,
as investors have priced in inventory corrections across all end-markets.
6. Longer duration real yields have arguably peaked. So even as the US Federal
Reserve continues to raise rates, valuations should not necessarily decline further.
Additionally, growth will again become scarce, likely leading investors to gravitate
back towards quality growth.
IT spending and semiconductor demand should prove
resilient, while valuations look compelling
What are the risks?:
1. Real interest rates could rise further, which would have a negative impact on the
valuation of long duration assets.
2. Weakness in consumer spending on personal computers and low-end smartphones
could spread to commercial and enterprise customers and other end-markets.

3. COVID beneficiaries such as the e-commerce sector might continue to underperform
as growth reverts to pre-pandemic trend lines.
4. The Ukraine war, the Sino-US trade war, and authoritarian and nationalist
movements, including supply chain nationalism, are creating uncertainty.
5. Regulation remains a risk.
Secular growth drivers should dominate short-term
concerns over a three-plus year horizon
In summary
We believe bottom-up fundamental stock research, combined with portfolio construction
discipline, is the best approach for navigating the uncertainty. We are revisiting each
company-level financial model to stress-test it for recession scenarios and ensure our
target prices are conservative.
We have analysed our holdings based on their revenue growth potential and stability
over the next three years, and the strength of their ‘moat’, or their competitive
positioning and balance sheet strength. We are invested in high-quality, stable-growth
names with deep ‘moats’. As for the more speculative growth stocks with longer
duration cash flows, our positions are modest.
We are looking for stocks that have de-risked or have idiosyncratic drivers that will
prove to be resilient in a recession. Examples include Micron Technology1, where
earnings revisions have fallen sharply and the stock is now trading at barely above
book value, and First Solar1, which has fully contracted all of its production for the next
two years, while US tax credits should allow it to expand production capacity.
We are confident that secular growth drivers will dominate short-term cyclical concerns
over a three-plus year investment horizon. We focus on owning sustainable leaders
or beneficiaries of the digital transformation, with enduring competitive advantages,
trading at compelling valuations.

CHINA
CHI LO
Senior market strategist APAC
Deglobalisation in the context of ‘China decoupling’
‘Decouple-from-China’ has been a market issue since the Sino-US trade war
started in 2018, with some large developed countries pushing for reshoring their
global production. This has led to concern about deglobalisation, or the breaking-
up of supply chains and decelerating cross-border trade and investment. These
developments have shaken the argument for investing in Asia, including China,
which lies at the heart of many global supply chains.
Restrictions on technology transfers, among other trade-disrupting measures, are
currently the biggest uncertainty for Asia; a third of its exports involve electronic and
other tech products.
The Covid-19 crisis aggravated the concern over the outlook for manufacturing in
Asia – disrupting global supply chains and creating shortages of everything from
building materials and car parts to semiconductors.
Asia’s supply chains shifting
Though these worries have driven some large companies to cut their sourcing from
or manufacturing operations in Asia and to shift them elsewhere, we see no large-
scale decoupling from either the region or from China.
Firstly, defying expectations that the trade war and the pandemic would crimp Sino-
US bilateral trade, trade actually rose from an annualised USD 620 billion in June
2018 to USD 801 billion in August 2022. This was partly because US shipments to",pdfplumber

China picked up, even though Chinese purchases fell short of the so-called Phase One
deal signed in January 2020.
Secondly, rather than reducing their reliance on Asian supply chains, US importers
have increased imports from the wider ASEAN region.1
Flows of foreign direct investment (FDI) to China have risen over the last six years
(see Exhibit 1).
Buying more from ASEAN does not mean
buying less or decoupling from China
No decoupling
Buying more from ASEAN does not mean buying less or decoupling from China.
Rather, this shift in the pattern of imports illustrates a so-called ‘China + 1’ strategy,
in which companies keep producing in China for the local market while moving some
capacity to ASEAN.
Relocation is a means to manage the supply chain disruption due to economic, political
and, most recently, Covid-19 considerations. This is reflected in the rising flow of FDI
to ASEAN (see Exhibit 2). The persistence of investment in China underscores our
long-held ‘Invest in China for China’ view since the US shifted its China policy from
constructive engagement to strategic competition in 2016.

Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.

Crucially, a large share of the FDI flows to ASEAN comes from China, which accounts
for 40% of the total now as compared to only 10% a few years ago. This actually
strengthens the supply-chain integration between ASEAN and China rather than
weakening it. Components used to be shipped from ASEAN to China, which then sold
them to the world markets. That made China the world’s factory. Now the process
appears to be reversing: China supplies ASEAN with products that power the region’s
exports to the world. This shift in the supply-chain integration process has expanded
the world’s factory to now include Asia.
The persistence of investment in China underscores
our long-held ‘Invest in China for China’ view
Implications
Asia’s supply chain shift also reflects China’s ‘dual circulation’ policy. Beijing aims to
use its internal growth impetus to drive domestic and regional growth. This potential
is a strong basis for long-term investment in emerging Asia and China.
From a macroeconomic perspective, this development will likely lead to strong
intra-regional economic linkages confounding the deglobalisation trend. With
inflation concerns rising and companies facing higher input price pressures, the cost
advantages of sourcing from Asia, whose supply chains have integrated further with
China, are becoming more obvious.
Subtle shifts are underway to make Asia an emerging production hub for world
markets. We see little evidence yet of global and regional decoupling from China.
One can run, but not hide, from the Middle Kingdom.

Resilience in private markets - infrastructure debt
Almost USD 10 trillion has now been invested in these markets, in what has
become a global and ever more diverse asset class spanning corporate loans,
real assets, structured finance and other instruments. In this article, we focus on
infrastructure debt.
Amid the search for yield and the need for portfolio quality, the private debt segment
is becoming increasingly relevant. Having grown by 13-14% a year over the past
decade, total private debt assets under management (AUM) now exceed well over
USD 1 trillion.
As an asset class, private debt has been resilient across economic cycles. As an
example, it was the only private markets asset class to have increased fundraising
every year since 2011, including during the pandemic.
For investors willing to invest their money for longer periods, private debt can be
a good portfolio diversifier, offering low volatility and a low correlation to listed
markets. Other attractions include an appealing relative value, inflation-linked cash
flows and an illiquidity premium over listed assets.
Floating rate instruments are part of the segment. They can be more attractive than
vanilla bonds as their coupon is linked to a base rate, allowing it to increase amid
rising market interest rates.",pdfplumber

Recession-proof essential services
Historically, infrastructure debt has shown itself to be a haven. This segment offers
a diverse range of exposures across many defensive sectors (see Exhibit 1) and risk-
return profiles.
Overall, we believe the segment is well positioned for recession, for the same reasons
that it navigated the pandemic better than other asset classes: many infrastructure
projects involve essential services that are in demand in times of boom and times
of bust. In other words, when times are tough, people will still need rail networks,
energy to heat and light their homes, etc.
Infrastructure debt is well positioned for recession
As investments, infrastructure assets – from fibre optic networks and car parks to
utilities and roads – are marked by high barriers to entry: projects cost large sums
to complete, keeping competitors at bay. Often, they involve monopolistic market
positions and regulated tariffs. Their long-dated cash flows across economic cycles
offer stability to investors.
Green infrastructure
Infrastructure debt also has environmental, social, and governance (ESG) aspects.
Many infrastructure assets are at the forefront of the energy transition and
digitalisation, partly on the back of the European Union's objectives for decarbonisation
and net zero by 2050.

These goals are driving investment decisions: Along with the large sums for phasing
out conventional energy in the utilities sector, more renewable energy infrastructure
will need to be built over the next few decades, for example, for electrified fleets and
the greater use of (green) hydrogen. As for the role of digitalisation in decarbonisation,
data analytics can help improve (energy) efficiency.
In selecting investments, our proprietary ESG framework has been fully integrated in
the investment process. It includes a comprehensive assessment by our Sustainability
Centre, while an independent consultant assesses the impact of each investment
based on induced and avoided emissions, the net environmental contribution and
‘temperature alignment’ with the Paris Accord.
Junior infrastructure debt, which delivers higher,
equity-like returns, could be an attractive option
Junior debt to weather the storm
Over the past 10 years, infrastructure debt has offered consistently higher yields
than listed bonds, partly due to the additional return investors receive for forgoing
the flexibility of publicly traded markets. While infrastructure debt returns have
remained fairly consistent, central bank rate rises have boosted yields on government
and corporate bonds, sapping the yield premium.
For investors seeking a yield similar to equivalently rated corporate bonds, this has
made the choice between these two asset classes less straightforward. However, we
believe junior infrastructure debt, which delivers higher, equity-like returns while
maintaining debt-like protections such as covenants, and contained risk, could be an
attractive option.
We see growing opportunities in the telecoms space: glass fibre networks are rolled
out in Europe, datacentres and telecom towers are needed for the explosion of data
usage and new 5G technology. Overall, we expect infrastructure debt as a segment to
expand further, not least as the need for financing around the energy transition and
decarbonisation continues to grow.",pdfplumber

The value of investments and the income they generate may go down as well as up and it is possible that investors will not recover their initial outlay.
Investing in emerging markets, or specialised or restricted sectors is likely to be subject to a higher than average volatility due to a high degree of
concentration, greater uncertainty because less information is available, there is less liquidity, or due to greater sensitivity to changes in market
conditions (social, political and economic conditions). Some emerging markets offer less security than the majority of international developed markets.
For this reason, services for portfolio transactions, liquidation and conservation on behalf of funds invested in emerging markets may carry greater risk.

Dear Clients,
To say 2022 was a tumultuous year is an understatement.
Equity markets, which had peaked in January, dropped precipitously in less
than two months as investors reacted to higher inflation and Russia’s invasion of
Ukraine. Inflation in turn triggered the tightening of monetary policy. Central
bank policy rates and interest rates across maturities rose at the fastest pace in
decades, driving bond prices down by unprecedented amounts. Oil and natural
gas prices gyrated as the Nord Stream 2 project was halted and other energy
export sanctions were imposed on Russia. Financial markets were further roiled
by growing global geopolitical tensions following the invasion of Ukraine but
also aggressive posturing by China, including toward Taiwan.
This year is likely to be less tumultuous for markets. Inflation is already
trending lower. Central banks are expected to continue to tighten, but not to the
extent seen in 2022. As a result, bonds will come under less pressure. Oil and
natural gas prices are less likely to gyrate.
Still, we face great uncertainty. The US Federal Reserve may overtighten
monetary policy and create a recession in the United States. A recession in the
world’s largest economy would reverberate globally. The US Congress may repeat
the mistakes of 2011 in failing to raise the debt limit in a timely and orderly
manner. China’s disorderly abandonment of its “zero-COVID” policy may
unleash another wave of COVID-19 infections, including new variants, globally.
The geopolitical outlook for 2023, too, is foggy and fraught with risk. There is
no face-saving off-ramp for Russia from Ukraine. China is unlikely to reverse its
assertive and aggressive posture. North Korea is expected to continue, even step
up, its ballistic missile tests. Iran may proceed to enrich its uranium to weapons-
grade levels, which could elicit a military response by Israel.
We proceed with caution.
We start with a careful review of the turmoil in financial markets last year
because this backdrop is important in understanding the fog of uncertainty still
facing investors.
Outlook Investment Strategy Group 1",pdfplumber
5,goldman_sachs_janvier_2023,Unknown,Unknown,3,"Among financial assets, none were spared in 2022. US equities, as measured
by the S&P 500, had a maximum drawdown of 25% and ended the year with
a total return of -18% (in line with the bad case scenario, to which we had
assigned a 15% probability in last year’s Outlook). The basket of FANGMANT
stocks (Facebook/Meta, Apple, Netflix, Google/Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon,
Nvidia and Tesla), with a maximum aggregate drawdown of 44%, were among
the worst-performing stocks in the S&P 500. Facebook/Meta and Tesla did
particularly poorly, experiencing maximum drawdowns of over 70%.
Outside the US, Russian equities had the largest drop, at 51%; China came
next, at 45%; they were followed by Italy at 28% and Germany at 26%—all in
local currency terms.
Also in 2022, bonds, which typically hedge portfolios against equity
drawdowns by rising in value, nose-dived in response to a steady stream of
rising inflation and interest rate hikes in the advanced economies. The maximum
drawdown in the price of 10-year US Treasuries was 22%. It seldom happens
that 10-year Treasuries—which have half the volatility of US equities—drop
nearly as much as these equities.
The maximum drawdown of 10-year German bunds was 21%, and that of
10-year UK gilts, 26%. This drop in the price of 10-year UK gilts stood in sharp
contrast to the 5% total return of UK equities, as measured by the FTSE 100.
The latter’s positive return was driven primarily by the energy sector and the
metals and mining sector.
Shorter-term bond benchmarks declined less but declined nonetheless: the
maximum drop was 11% for 1- to 10- year US Treasuries, 12% for 1- to 10-year
German bunds and 15% for UK gilts.
Oil and natural gas were thrown into turmoil with the invasion of Ukraine,
and energy security has been thrust back into the forefront after a long hiatus.
West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil prices rose 62% between January and June
2022, only to fall 42% to their subsequent trough in early December; for the
year, WTI rose 7%. Similarly, Brent oil prices rose 59%, then fell 38%, ending
the year up 10%. Natural gas prices were even more volatile, with the biggest
moves seen in Europe, where prices shot up nearly fivefold by August before

forecast last year to be 3.9%, is now estimated to be 50% lower, at 2.0%.
The US Consumer Price Index (CPI) reached a peak of 9.1% in June 2022.
Core CPI, which excludes food and energy prices, peaked at 6.6% in September
2022. The US Federal Reserve’s preferred measure, the Personal Consumption
Expenditures (PCE) price index, peaked at 7.0%, also in June, and the core PCE
price index peaked at 5.4% in February. Eurozone and UK inflation rates likely
peaked in October at 10.6% and 11.1%, respectively. We expect US inflation to
decline to 3.7%, as measured by headline CPI, by the end of 2023.
In 2022, central banks raised rates at one of the fastest paces on record to
combat inflation. As shown in Exhibit 1, such a pace has not been seen in the
US since the early 1980s, when the country faced inflation that peaked at nearly
14.8% in March 1980. The pace has also never been seen in the history of
the European Central Bank since its inception in 1998. Such a large and rapid
increase in policy rates contributed to the turmoil in financial markets; we do not
expect a repeat in 2023.

to Asia ex-Japan. Still others recommended adding trading strategies, including
hedge funds and momentum- and volatility-based strategies.
The proliferation of such recommendations prompted some of our clients to
ask whether they should reevaluate their strategic asset allocation accordingly.
Our response is twofold.
First, appropriate, customized diversification for both institutional and private
wealth clients has been a key pillar of the Investment Strategy Group’s (ISG’s)
investment philosophy since its inception more than 20 years ago in 2001 (see
Exhibit 2). Such diversification around a core holding of equities and bonds
already includes asset classes and investment strategies that enhance risk/return
to preserve and then maximize risk-adjusted wealth, especially at times of
heightened uncertainty.
Second, nearly a hundred years of data demonstrates that a mixture of stocks
and bonds is an effective starting point for a portfolio, consistent with another
pillar of ISG’s investment philosophy that history is a useful guide. The 60/40
portfolio has generated positive returns on a rolling 12-month basis 80% of the
time since 1926.
Geopolitical Tumult
On the geopolitical front, the warning of the late Ash Carter, former US secretary
of defense, was realized. We regularly consulted with him on geopolitical issues,
and as was outlined in our 2022 Outlook: Piloting Through, he had asserted that
the Russian threat to Ukraine was “the most dangerous, dire, and imminent of
all the geopolitical risks.”1 So far, the Russia-Ukraine war has led to:
• About 100,000 casualties on each side, according to General Mark Milley,
chairman of the US Joint Chiefs of Staff2
• The exodus of 7.8 million Ukrainian refugees to other countries, particularly in
Europe, and another 6.5 million displaced from their homes within Ukraine3
Outlook Investment Strategy Group 5",pdfplumber
5,goldman_sachs_janvier_2023,Unknown,Unknown,7,"• Over $100 billion in global military, financial and humanitarian aid to Ukraine
(about half from the US), with at least another $45 billion expected in 20234
• A World Bank estimate of $525 billion−$630 billion of reconstruction in
Ukraine as of December5
The war has also led to further deterioration in US-China relations, especially
when coupled with the joint China-Russia statement on February 4, 2022, that
the “friendship between the two States has no limits.”6 The US and its allies have
been changing their national security strategies toward China and imposing
import and export controls on a wide variety of products.
Turmoil in financial markets coupled with heightened geopolitical risks has
raised the risks, though not the certainty, of a recession. Historically, rapid
and extensive tightening by the Federal Reserve has led to recession in the US.
Many economists expect it. Bill Dudley, who served as president and CEO
of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, vice chair of the Federal Reserve
Open Market Committee (FOMC) and Goldman Sachs partner, assigns a 70%
probability to a US recession in 2023—one of the highest probability forecasts in
the industry.
At the other extreme, Jan Hatzius, currently Goldman Sachs’ chief economist
and head of Global Investment Research, assigns a 35% probability to a US
recession—one of the lowest in the industry. Incidentally, Dudley and Hatzius
developed the Goldman Sachs Financial Conditions Index while they worked
together at Goldman Sachs. The index measures the impact of Federal Reserve
policy on the economy through the impact on the financial markets, specifically
on short- and intermediate-maturity interest rates, equity markets, incremental
yield of corporate bonds and the value of the trade-weighted dollar relative to
other currencies. The wide difference between the forecasts of these two former
colleagues is mirrored across the economic forecasting community.
Notably, in his latest press conference, on December 14, 2022, Jerome H.
Powell, chair of the Federal Reserve, said “I don’t think anyone knows whether
we’re going to have a recession or not … It’s just not knowable.”7
6 Goldman Sachs january 2023",pdfplumber
5,goldman_sachs_janvier_2023,Unknown,Unknown,8,"Similarly, a week later, Lawrence H. Summers, Harvard University professor
and former US Treasury secretary, wrote that “there is no basis for confident
economic prediction. Some of the most stridently made arguments are also the
silliest.”8
When Chair Powell says that “it’s just not knowable,” we take heed; we assign
a range of 45−55% to the probability of a US recession in 2023. To provide
context: over the last decade, the highest probability we assigned to a recession
was 30%. That was in our 2012 Outlook, after the European sovereign debt
crisis; the next-highest probability was 20−25%, in our 2020 Outlook.
Today, many leading indicators are pointing in opposite directions, and we
believe it is important to convey this uncertainty to our clients unequivocally.
In this uncertain environment, we believe portfolios should not be positioned
for the certainty of recession nor for the certainty of modest economic growth.
Instead, we recommend portfolios be positioned at their customized strategic
asset allocation, where they are designed to ride out volatility and provide staying
power in the event of geopolitical disruptions.
If a recession is averted, financial market returns in 2023 will be less volatile
than in 2022; we expect a moderate-risk diversified portfolio of stocks and bonds to
provide a total return of 9.0% for taxable clients and 9.8% for tax-exempt clients.
If a recession occurs early in the year, corporate earnings and equities will
decline—possibly beyond the maximum drawdown of 2022—but bonds will
hedge the portfolio by increasing in value, because the starting point of interest
rates is much higher than it was at the beginning of 2022. However, by the end
of 2023, as the recession recedes and the fog of uncertainty lifts, the equity
market will most likely rally. We would expect high-single-digit returns for
a moderate-risk diversified portfolio. If the recession lasts beyond year-end,
the equity market will most likely end the year near the lows we saw in 2022,
providing a total return of negative 4.4% from year-end 2022 and resulting in a
low- to mid-single-digit negative return for a moderate-risk portfolio.
Facing the fog of uncertainty in financial markets, economic growth and
geopolitics, we will on our side:
Outlook Investment Strategy Group 7",pdfplumber
5,goldman_sachs_janvier_2023,Unknown,Unknown,9,"• Watch diligently for hazards and, if appropriate, pull into a safe location and
wait for the fog to clear.
• Use our fog lights to search for tactical strategies that can take advantage of
market volatility as opportunities present themselves.
On our clients’ side, we recommend that you:
• Avoid unnecessary lane changes; stay invested at your customized strategic
asset allocation.
• Allow extra time to reach your destination, as US equity markets will resume
their historical upward trajectory.
In Section I, we provide the rationale for assigning a 45−55% probability to
the risk of a US recession in 2023. We compare this tightening cycle to past
tightening cycles and explain that although a recession is possible, it is not
inevitable. We explain why staying invested in such an uncertain environment
is our recommended course of action. In a March 2009 Sunday Night Insight
titled Near-Term Pain, Long-Term Gain, we quoted the highly respected investor
Seth Klarman of Baupost, who wrote: “To maintain a truly long-term view,
investors must be willing to experience significant short-term losses; without
the possibility of near-term pain, there can be no long-term gain. The ability
to remain an investor (and not become a day-trader or a bystander) confers an
almost unprecedented advantage in this environment.”9
Next, we spell out our one- and five-year expected returns and review our
opportunistic tactical tilts coming into 2023. We currently have the lowest level
of risk allocated to tactical tilts of the last decade.
We conclude Section I with the key risks to our outlook beyond the recession
risks, primarily focused on geopolitical flare-ups and possible new COVID-19
waves originating from China.

has become more aggressive and assertive in its

been interpreted as an improvement in US-China

justified. While China’s removal of all COVID

US Debt Ceiling
David Mericle and Alec Phillips, our colleagues in
Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research, have
highlighted raising the debt ceiling in 2023 as a
significant risk to equity and bond markets. The
debt ceiling limits how much debt the Treasury
can issue to fund the US government and meet its
coupon and principal payment obligations. The US
is expected to reach its debt limit by August 2023,
but it may be as late as October.

5,goldman_sachs_janvier_2023,Unknown,Unknown,49,"Key Takeaways
While we are facing a period of heightened uncertainty after a
tumultuous 2022, we believe our two primary investment themes
remain valid: US Preeminence and Staying Invested. US Preeminence
leads us to overweight US assets in our strategic asset allocation. Staying
Invested drives our recommendation that clients maintain their strategic
asset allocation; that recommendation will change if we develop high
conviction that a recession is imminent and not already discounted by
the market. Currently, we do not have high conviction that a recession
is imminent and one has already been partially discounted by the equity
market decline.
The key takeaways from our 2023 Outlook are as follows:
• Below-Trend Growth: We expect global economic growth to slow to
below-trend levels. We believe the US will have modest growth; the
Eurozone, the UK and Russia will be in recession; and that Japan will be
an exception with above-trend growth. Large emerging market countries
will grow below trend at mid-single-digit growth levels, in our view. We
estimate China’s post-COVID recovery will reach 4.9%, just above trend
levels of 4−4.5%.
• Monetary Policy Tightening: We believe that most major central banks
will continue tightening monetary policy but at a more modest pace than
in 2022. China will be a key exception as the leadership tries to stem the
declines in the property sector.
• Recession Risk in the US: We have assigned a 45−55% range to the risk
of recession in 2023. We believe the fog of uncertainty is too great to have
much conviction on the direction of the US economy, and we therefore
recommend clients position their portfolios neither for the certainty

The returns are driven by equity returns of over 10% in developed markets
and 9% in emerging markets. We expect mid-single-digit returns in fixed

• Significant Geopolitical Risks: We face a much longer litany of geopolitical
risks this year, including an escalation of the Russia-Ukraine war, high US-
China tensions, more ballistic missile testing by North Korea, a growing
partnership between Iran and Russia, continued nuclear enrichment in Iran
and debt ceiling negotiations in the US.
• Vigilance: In the face of fog, we diligently watch for hazards and will
remain tactical to take advantage of market opportunities.

2023 Global
Economic Outlook:
A Difficult Balancing Act
around the world, policymakers are attempting to cross
a tightrope. For global central banks, the challenge is to lift
interest rates high enough to dampen growth and bring down
inflation, but not so high that they cause undue economic
fallout. Similarly, governments are seeking to administer enough
fiscal stimulus to help consumers cope with high prices but not
so much that they stoke even worse inflation in the process. In
both cases, leaning too far in either direction could be harmful.
To be sure, the risk of a misstep is high. Global central
banks collectively delivered more than 280 interest rate hikes
last year in response to inflation that was both higher and more
persistent than expected.43 Such forceful tightening of monetary
policy clearly raises the risk of recession. At the same time,
already stretched fiscal finances and fragile bond markets limit

6,jpmorgan_private_banking_global_view_2023,Unknown,Unknown,1,"Foreword
Every year presents unique challenges. In 2020, together we confronted a global
pandemic and lockdown. In 2021, global economies slowly reopened as parts of
the world returned to more normal patterns of life.
2022 has brought new headwinds, some we haven’t seen in over 40 years.
As inflation proved more resilient than anticipated, rising to highs we haven’t seen
in decades, central banks aggressively raised rates to slow its progress. With both
stocks and bonds suffering significant losses, 2022 delivered one of the worst
years ever for balanced portfolios.
From a geopolitical perspective, Russia’s invasion of Ukraine caused great human
suffering and disrupted global markets.
To prepare for the year ahead, we rely on our world-class Global Investment
Strategy Group to help us identify both the risks and opportunities that investors
may face. Despite the headwinds to growth, they see the potential for stronger
markets in 2023 and beyond.
In times like these, we rely on each other and on the relationships we have
created over time. We are honored to stand by your side.
Thank you for your continued trust and confidence in J.P. Morgan.

Out of
the depths
Most things that could have gone wrong for
investors did in 2022. Markets that entered the
year with extended valuations buckled in the
face of elevated inflation, an aggressive global
rate hiking cycle, war in Ukraine and economic
challenges in China.
Unusually, both stocks and bonds suffered big
losses in 2022—one of the worst years ever for a
balanced portfolio.
5",pdfplumber
6,jpmorgan_private_banking_global_view_2023,Unknown,Unknown,5,"INTRODUCTION
As we move into 2023, investors still have
many difficult questions to consider.
How much further
could interest rates rise?
When will inflation
come back to earth?
Is a recession inevitable,
and how bad could it get?
6",pdfplumber
6,jpmorgan_private_banking_global_view_2023,Unknown,Unknown,6,"INTRODUCTION
In this year’s outlook, we evaluate the fallout from a historic
global tightening cycle—higher interest rates will rein in
inflation, but recessions are likely in the United States and
Europe—and we assess the degree to which market pricing
already reflects a future downturn.
Even as economic growth deteriorates, we think markets
could stabilize in 2023.
Higher bond yields offer total return potential, and they
could provide portfolios with valuable ballast during a
downturn. Equity markets may remain challenged by
weaker earnings growth, but stock prices now incorporate
a substantial degree of future damage.
Precisely because markets are so battered, lower equity
valuations and higher bond yields, in our view, mean that
investors now enjoy the most attractive entry point for
a traditional portfolio in over a decade. Already, market
dislocations have appeared that investors can take
advantage of. Those with capital to invest can find the
potential for compelling returns across asset classes and
risk levels.
As you design and revise your goals-based plan, that’s
welcome news indeed.

As of late 2022, 26 of the 31 central
banks that we track were raising
rates, up from just two at the start
of 2021. The Federal Reserve (Fed)
engaged in its most aggressive round
of interest rate hikes in 40 years.
The European Central Bank (ECB) has been no less forceful,
recently raising its policy rate by 0.75% to levels last seen
before the global financial crisis (GFC). And the ECB seems
set to keep raising rates despite the clear threats to growth.
After a little over a decade of low or negative policy rates,
the campaign against inflation caused a historic rout in bond
markets. The Barclays Global Aggregate Index is on track to
lose over 10% in 2022, its worst year on record. Negative
yielding debt (a pervasive feature of the post-GFC landscape)

As we assess the asset class, the high yield bond market is pricing

quality, but not yet an outright recession. Even so, its all-in yield of
nearly 10% offers an attractive alternative to equity exposure even
after accounting for potential losses from default.
Meanwhile, preferred equities could be interesting for some
investors. They display characteristics of both fixed income (prices
are determined in part by interest rates) and equities (they react to
changing perceptions about corporate earnings). Both rising rates
and concerns about economic growth sparked a ~20% drawdown
in these securities so far this year.
We like the entry point for preferred equities. Unlike high yield
bonds, default risk is more limited, given that investment grade
companies are the most common issuers. What’s more, prices
could rebound if yields decline. U.S. taxpayers also benefit from

Unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities typically offer a higher yield than investment grade Debt Securities, but also present greater risks with respect to liquidity, volatility,
and non-payment of principal and interest. As a result of being classified as non investment grade Debt Securities, these Debt Securities present a greater degree of credit risk
relative to many other fixed income Debt Securities.
Higher Credit Risk –Unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities generally have predominantly speculative characteristics with respect to the issuer’s capacity to pay interest
and repay principal. There is greater risk of non-payment of interest and loss of principal. Many issuers of these Debt Securities have experienced substantial difficulties in servicing
their debt obligations, which has led to default and restructurings. The issuers of these Debt Securities generally have to pay a higher rate of interest than investment grade Debt
Securities.
Higher Liquidity and Secondary Market Risk –The markets in which unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities are traded aregenerally more limited than those in which
investment grade Debt Securities are traded. This lack of liquidity may make it more difficult to resell these Debt Securities and obtain market quotations.
Downgrade Risk –Downgrades in the credit rating of unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities by rating agencies are generally accompanied by declines in the market value
of these Debt Securities. In some circumstances, investors in the unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities market may anticipate such downgrades as a result of these
credits being placed on “credit watch” by rating agencies, causing volatility and speculation of further credit deterioration.
Higher Vulnerability to economic cycles -During economic downturns, unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities are typically more susceptible to price volatility and fall more
in value than investment grade Debt Securities as i) investors may reevaluate holdings in lower-quality bonds in favor of investment-grade corporate Debt Securities; ii) investors
become more risk averse; and iii) default risk rises. This is often referred to a “flight to quality”.
Event Risk –This includes any of a variety of events that can adversely affect the issuer of unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities, and therefore the issuer’s ability to meet
debt service obligations to repay principal and interest to Debt Securities holders. Event risk may pertain to the issuer specifically, the industry or business sector of the issuer, or
generally upon the overall economy. It could have a direct or indirect impact on the issuer and their outstanding debts.
Important Disclosure on RMB
Risk relating to RMB –If you choose RMB as the base currency or the alternate currency, you should also note the following:
RMB is currently not freely convertible through banks in Hong Kong. Due to exchange controls and/or restrictions imposed on the convertibility, utilization or transferability of RMB (if
any) which in turn is affected by, amongst other things, the PRC government's control, there is no guarantee that disruption in the transferability, convertibility or liquidity of RMB will
not occur. There is thus a likelihood that you may not be able to convert RMB received into other freely convertible currencies.
CNH exchange rates and CNY exchange rates are currently quoted in different markets with different exchange rates, whereby theirexchange rate movements may not be in the
same direction or magnitude. Therefore, the CNH exchange rate may be different from the CNY exchange rate.",pdfplumber

Important Disclosure on High Yield Bonds
Unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities typically offer a higher yield than investment grade Debt Securities, but also present greater risks with respect to liquidity,
volatility, and non-payment of principal and interest. As a result of being classified as non investment grade Debt Securities, these Debt Securities present a greater degree of credit
risk relative to many other fixed income Debt Securities.
Higher Credit Risk –Unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities generally have predominantly speculative characteristics with respect to the issuer’s capacity to pay interest
and repay principal. There is greater risk of non-payment of interest and loss of principal. Many issuers of these Debt Securities have experienced substantial difficulties in servicing
their debt obligations, which has led to default and restructurings. The issuers of these Debt Securities generally have to pay a higher rate of interest than investment grade Debt
Securities.
Higher Liquidity and Secondary Market Risk –The markets in which unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities are traded aregenerally more limited than those in which
investment grade Debt Securities are traded. This lack of liquidity may make it more difficult to resell these Debt Securities and obtain market quotations.
Downgrade Risk –Downgrades in the credit rating of unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities by rating agencies are generally accompanied by declines in the market value
of these Debt Securities. In some circumstances, investors in the unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities market may anticipate such downgrades as a result of these
credits being placed on “credit watch” by rating agencies, causing volatility and speculation of further credit deterioration.
Higher Vulnerability to economic cycles -During economic downturns, unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities are typically more susceptible to price volatility and fall
more in value than investment grade Debt Securities as i) investors may reevaluate holdings in lower-quality bonds in favor of investment-grade corporate Debt Securities; ii)
investors become more risk averse; and iii) default risk rises. This is often referred to a “flight to quality”.
Event Risk –This includes any of a variety of events that can adversely affect the issuer of unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities, and therefore the issuer’s ability to meet
debt service obligations to repay principal and interest to Debt Securities holders. Event risk may pertain to the issuer specifically, the industry or business sector of the issuer, or
generally upon the overall economy. It could have a direct or indirect impact on the issuer and their outstanding debts.
Important Disclosure on RMB
Risk relating to RMB –If you choose RMB as the base currency or the alternate currency, you should also note the following:
RMB is currently not freely convertible through banks in Hong Kong. Due to exchange controls and/or restrictions imposed on the convertibility, utilization or transferability of RMB
(if any) which in turn is affected by, amongst other things, the PRC government's control, there is no guarantee that disruptionin the transferability, convertibility or liquidity of
RMB will not occur. There is thus a likelihood that you may not be able to convert RMB received into other freely convertiblecurrencies.
CNH exchange rates and CNY exchange rates are currently quoted in different markets with different exchange rates, whereby theirexchange rate movements may not be in the
same direction or magnitude. Therefore, the CNH exchange rate may be different from the CNY exchange rate.",pdfplumber

Point Break
We expect 2023 to be a year filled with macro inflection points as inflation and monetary policy pressures start to diminish.
Alongside this transition, we believe investor prioritization of profitability over revenue and sticky income over the uncertainty of
capital appreciation will be paramount. Market opportunities have already reset and investing next year may feature more of 1)
stocks with durable cash flows, 2) quality bonds with significant coupons, and 3) alternatives with volatility-reducing attributes.
SUPPLY TIMELINES: The share of manufacturing companies reporting faster supplier
delivery times has increased 171% since the beginning of 20221.
WORKING HOURS: Global labor supply remains squeezed. The ILO estimates total work
hours to stay 1.5% below pre-pandemic levels, equating to a deficit of 40mm full-time jobs2.
TRAVEL SURGE: The daily number of passengers screened at TSA checkpoints has
ACTIVITY jumped by 17x relative to the pandemic low in 20203.
HOME EQUITY:Only 2% of US mortgages have negative equity today versus 25% in
20114. Home prices would need to fall by 30% from 2021 levels to meaningfully erode loan-
to-value ratios and increase strategic defaults.
CREDIT TRENDS:While US loan delinquencies remain subdued, spending has rotated
from discretionary to essential; top areas of credit acceleration—automotive parts, gas, and
materials—have discouraged borrowing for recreation, clothing, and food services5.
CONSUMERS
BAD MOOD:The UMichiganConsumer Sentiment Index printed below 60 in seven
consecutive months, the longest stretch since inception as sticky costs diminish morale6.
SINGLE STOCK: As of 3Q, 80% of S&P 500 companies have seen their equity prices fall at
least 10% at some point this year, providing a large base for tax-loss harvesting7.
UP DOWN: Performance swings have been more volatile this year relative to the long-term
average. Positive days in 2022 have returned a daily average of 1.31% while negative days
have posted an average drag of -1.14%, much wider than the historical bounds of +0.75%7.
EQUITIES TECH BREAK: The market value loss for mega tech stocks this year is equivalent to the
annual GDP of UK or France8.
YIELD LAGGARD: A year ago, ~25% of global government debt offered negative nominal
yields. Today, Japan is the last remaining sovereign borrower with negative-yielding debt,
comprising <5% of all government debt8.
COST BENEFIT: Rate volatility has exceeded the 90th percentile relative to the past ten
years. Still, US Treasuries are yielding 5.5x more per unit of volatility than US stocks8.
FIXED
INCOME DURATION LIMITS: The risk and cost of a rate shock are lower and less punitive today
relative to earlier this year. While a 100 bp rate shock may drag the Bloomberg US
Aggregate Bond Index by -6.2%, a coupon offset of 2.7% may ultimately limit left-tail risks9.

n How can core inflation fall so much with such a small employment hit? The Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
reason, we think, is that this cycle is different from prior high-inflation periods.
First, post-pandemic labor market overheating showed up not in excessive
employment but in unprecedented job openings, which are much less painful to
unwind. Second, the disinflationary impact of the recent normalization in supply
chains and rental housing markets still has a long way to go. And third,
long-term inflation expectations remain well-anchored.
n The Euro area and the UK are probably in recession, mainly because of the real
income hit from surging energy bills. But we expect only a mild downturn as
Europe has already managed to cut Russian gas imports without crushing
activity and is likely to benefit from the same post-pandemic improvements that
are helping avoid US recession. Given reduced risks of a deep downturn and
persistent inflation, we now expect hikes through May with a 3% ECB peak.
n China is likely to grow slowly in H1 as an April reopening initially triggers an
increase in Covid cases that keeps caution high, but should accelerate sharply in
H2 on a reopening boost. Our longer-run China view remains cautious because
of the long slide in the property market as well as slower potential growth
(reflecting weakness in both demographics and productivity).
n Several central banks in Central/Eastern Europe and Latin America started hiking
rates well before their DM peers. While none has clearly achieved a soft landing
yet, activity has been resilient and inflation is now coming down in some
countries, especially Brazil. CEE is in a more difficult position because of its
commodity exposure, high inflation, and ongoing monetary tightening.

US Likely to Avoid Recession
In the past year, US growth has slowed to a below-potential pace of about 1% because
of a diminishing reopening boost, declining real disposable income (driven by fiscal
normalization and high inflation), and aggressive monetary tightening. In our forecast,
growth remains at roughly this pace in 2023. Unlike a year ago, when our forecast for
both 2022 and 2023 was below consensus because we expected a negative impact of
monetary and especially fiscal tightening, our current 2023 forecast is well above
consensus (Exhibit 2).

Our disagreement with the consensus is even more visible when we focus on recession
probabilities. As shown in Exhibit 3, we estimate a 35% probability that the US
economy enters recession over the next 12 months, well below the median of 65%
among the forecasters in the latest Wall Street Journal survey and toward the bottom of

Why is our recession probability—while more than twice as high as the unconditional
probability of entering recession in any given 12-month period—still clearly below 50%?
One immediate reason is that the incoming activity data are nowhere close to
recessionary. The advance GDP report showed 2.6% (annualized) growth in Q3,
nonfarm payrolls grew 261k in October, and there were 225k initial jobless claims in the
week of November 5.
More fundamentally, there are strong reasons to expect positive growth in coming
quarters. To be sure, the tightening in financial conditions is weighing heavily on
growth, to the tune of nearly 2pp at present. But real disposable personal income is
rebounding from the plunge seen in H1—when fiscal tightening and sharply higher
inflation took their toll—to a pace of 3%+over the next year (Exhibit 4). And while there
are risks on both sides, we think the real income upturn is likely to be the stronger force
as we move through 2023, especially because the financial conditions drag will likely
diminish assuming Fed officials do not deliver dramatically more tightening than the
rates market is currently pricing.

But the most fundamental question is this: how can the Fed bring down inflation by 2
percentage points over the next year with only a ½pp increase in the unemployment
rate (Exhibit 5)? Doesn’t this fly in the face of the experience from prior high-inflation
episodes—most notably the 1970s—that ended with a much bigger increase in
unemployment?
Our answer is that this cycle is different from prior high-inflation periods.

The first reason why this cycle is different is that post-pandemic labor market
overheating showed up not in excessive employment but in unprecedented job
openings. As shown in Exhibit 6, job openings surged in 2020-2021 as employers
sought to keep up with the strongest economic recovery on record amidst continuing
Covid fears and exceptionally generous unemployment benefits. However, employment
as a share of the labor force only rose to roughly the pre-pandemic level, not above.
16 November 2022 5",pdfplumber
12,goldman_sachs_global_outlook,Unknown,Unknown,5,"Goldman Sachs Global Economics Analyst
(And employment relative to the working-age population remains below the
pre-pandemic level.)

Now, however, the environment looks very different. Demand has slowed, the
pandemic has subsided, unemployment benefits have normalized, and excess savings
are coming down. It is therefore not surprising that job openings and our jobs-workers
gap—total labor demand minus total labor supply—are coming down quickly. Based on
timely job openings measures from Linkup and Indeed, we estimate that the
jobs-workers gap has declined from a peak of nearly 6 million to just over 4 million,
nearly half of the way to the 2mn level required to slow wage growth to a rate
compatible with the inflation target (Exhibit 7, left panel). Partly because of the
reduction in the jobs-workers gap, timely measures of nominal wage growth, i.e.
composition-adjusted average hourly earnings and our monthly wage survey composite,
have slowed to levels consistent with 4½% wage growth (Exhibit 7, right panel).

The second reason why this cycle is different is that the recent normalization in supply
chains and rental housing markets is a source of disinflation not seen in previous
high-inflation episodes such as the 1970s, and it is only beginning to show up in the
official numbers (Exhibit 8). On the goods side, the ongoing rotation from goods to
services spending, healing supply chains, and rebounding inventory levels should put
downward pressure on core goods prices. On the services side, asking rents on new
leases have decelerated sharply after the one-time jump in rents related to the work
from home-related increase in demand for space. The October CPI report suggests that
the lagging measure of sequential monthly official CPI shelter inflation—which captures
both new and continuing leases—has likely peaked too. Although year-on-year shelter
inflation will likely rise through next spring as rents on continuing leases catch up to
higher market rates, it is set to slow thereafter.

The third reason is that long-term inflation expectations remain well-anchored, especially
relative to the 1970s. This is true for each of the available measures, namely those
based on 1) surveys of households, 2) surveys of economic forecasters, and 3)
inflation-protected bonds. Measures of short-term inflation expectations remain
relatively high, but much of this probably reflects the spike in commodity prices and
should wane if commodity prices level off. The fact that inflation has only been high for
a short and unusual pandemic period also suggests that elevated inflation is not
entrenched (Exhibit 9).

One might assume that our relatively optimistic inflation forecast translates into a
relatively dovish Fed call. But that assumption would be wrong. The reason comes
back to the interplay between real income and financial conditions. As real income
recovers, a negative FCI growth impulse is required to keep growth below potential and
continue rebalancing the labor market. However, the negative FCI impulse on
sequential growth will likely diminish from its current drag of around 2pp annualized
because it depends on the change in, rather than the level of, financial conditions
(Exhibit 4, right panel). As a result, and even under our relatively optimistic inflation
forecast, additional rate hikes of at least as much as markets are now pricing are likely
required to keep the labor market adjustment going. Following the FCI easing over the
past month, we now expect an additional 125bp of Fed rate hikes (vs. 100bp previously)
with a downshift in the hiking pace to 50bp in December, and three smaller 25bp hikes
in February, March, and now also May. Our new 5-5.25% peak funds rate is modestly
above market pricing (Exhibit 11).

With a resilient labor market and still elevated inflation, we don’t see any rate cuts in
2023 unless the economy enters recession after all. In our no-recession forecast, the
Fed only implements a first gentle 25bp cut in 2024Q2. This baseline of “high rates for
longer” would again illustrate how different this cycle is as the first Fed cut in the
median hiking cycle has historically come roughly six months after the last hike.

A Mild Recession in Europe
In contrast to the US, the Euro area and the UK are probably in recession. The reason
for this is the much bigger and more drawn-out increase in household energy bills,
which should boost headline inflation to peaks of 12% in the Euro area and 11% in the
UK, far higher than in the US (Exhibit 12, left panel).
Exhibit 12: A Bigger Energy Shock in Europe Implies a Worse Outlook for Inflation and Real Income
Source: Haver Analytics, Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research
In turn, high inflation is set to weigh on real income, consumption, and industrial
production. We forecast further declines in real income of 1½% in the Euro area
through 2023Q1 and 3% in the UK through 2023Q2, before a pickup in H2 (Exhibit 12,
right panel). The plunge in timely and forward-looking surveys of gas-intensive European
industries such as chemicals and metals also suggests that rising energy costs will
lower production (Exhibit 13). As a result, we look for cumulative declines in real GDP of
0.7% in the Euro area (2022Q4-2023Q2) and 1.7% in the UK (2022Q3-2023Q2).

Exhibit 13: Surveys of Gas-Intensive European Industries Have Plunged
Source: Haver Analytics, Eurostat, Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research
However, we don’t expect a deep European downturn, barring a very cold winter that
imposes more severe energy rationing on the industrial sector in order to keep people
warm in their homes.
Already, Europe has cut Russian gas imports by 80% and total gas consumption by
20-25% without crushing aggregate activity. In fact, most of the hard economic data (as
opposed to the surveys) continue to hold up remarkably well so far, with industrial
production moving sideways, real GDP still up in the Euro area in Q3 (though down
slightly in the UK), and labor markets holding up so far.
We think the reason for this resilience is that household energy savings and substitution
to other energy sources have helped absorb the collapse in Russian gas imports. Along
with mild weather, these savings have boosted gas storage, reduced TTF gas prices by
60% from their peak, and reduced downside risk from a very cold winter.
Moreover, Europe is likely to benefit from three similar post-pandemic sources of
resilience that are helping the US avoid recession altogether. First, Exhibit 14 shows
that the rise in German production of chip-intensive items and cars—where pandemic
bottlenecks are still easing—has approximately offset the ongoing decline in
energy-intensive production.

Second, any decline in the household saving rate would support consumer spending, as
happened in the US when real income plunged in early 2022. Exhibit 15 points to room
in Europe for saving rates to fall and for consumer credit growth to pick up (although
likely by less than in the US because European lower-income households have relatively
limited excess savings). Third, while the bulk of reopening gains are behind us, Europe
is still benefiting somewhat from a rebound in the service sector.

While near-term risks of a deep recession have receded somewhat and our commodity
strategists now look for a more limited rise in European gas prices next summer, we
don’t expect GDP to rebound sharply in Europe once it exits a mild recession. The main
reason is that energy prices will likely stay high until sufficient new energy supply and/or
16 November 2022 13",pdfplumber
12,goldman_sachs_global_outlook,Unknown,Unknown,13,"Goldman Sachs Global Economics Analyst
major efficiency gains materialize. Moreover, fiscal policy turns should turn into a drag
from the second half of 2023 onwards.
Incorporating both the resilience in incoming hard data and our less elevated path for
gas prices, we have nudged up our Euro area 2023 growth forecast to -0.1% (from
-0.4% previously).
What about European core inflation? Although commodities drove the initial headline
surge, price pressures have broadened significantly across core categories in both the
Euro area and the UK following upside inflation surprises (Exhibit 16, left panel). In fact,
UK core price pressures are now the broadest across the G10, with a perfect storm of
an energy crisis (like continental Europe) and an overheated labor market (like the US).
Given this strong momentum, we expect Euro area core inflation to edge up further to a
peak of 5.3% year-over-year in December, before gradually declining to just above 3%
by end-2023 on goods disinflation. In the UK, we think that core inflation is peaking
right around now and will also decline to 3% by end-2023.
Exhibit 16: Broad Core Price Pressures in Europe Imply Additional ECB and BoE Hikes to Peaks of 3% and 4.5%, Respectively
Source: Haver Analytics, Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research
Given reduced risks of deep recession and persistent inflationary pressures, we now
expect the ECB to hike through May with an additional 150bp of rate hikes to a peak
deposit rate of 3% (vs. 2.75% previously). Along with the reduction in near-term
headline inflation pressures from gas prices, the emphasis on substantial rate hikes so
far increases our conviction that the ECB will step down the pace to 50bp in December,
in parallel with the Fed. We maintain our forecast for a second 50bp hike in February
but, given the firmer demand outlook, now look for two additional smaller 25bp hikes at
the March and May meetings. The risks around our peak 3% ECB rate are two-sided,
with upside risk from potentially more persistent core inflation and downside risk from
a deeper recession or a possible flare-up in sovereign risk in Italy. Given the tight labor
market, high wage pressures, and firm inflation, we expect the BoE to hike Bank Rate
by an additional 150bp to a terminal rate of 4.5%.

China’s Bumpy Reopening
Our 2023 China outlook is a story of two halves with slow growth in the first half
followed by a more pronounced rebound in the second half as the economy reopens
(Exhibit 17).
We expect weak growth in Q4 and Q1 as the Zero Covid Policy (ZCP) likely stays in
place during the winter. In fact, the recent sharp rise in cases led us to have a
significantly below-consensus Q4 estimate of 1.2% annualized.

Although the leadership has clearly signaled that it aims to exit ZCP, we do not expect
actual reopening to start until April. The basic reason for this is that medical and
communication preparations will take time. Less than 70% of the 60+ age group in
Mainland China are triple-vaccinated (Exhibit 18), and data from Hong Kong show that
the unvaccinated elderly remain at serious risk of severe outcomes. As a result, China
will need to significantly ramp up its vaccination pace from the current 100k/day before
reopening can safely begin.

Despite our April reopening baseline, we forecast Q2 growth of just 2% annualized on
our assumption that reopening initially triggers an increase in infections that keeps
caution high. Weak growth in East Asian economies such as South Korea, Taiwan, and
Hong Kong during the first quarter of exiting ZCP also supports our soft Q2 forecast.
In contrast, we look for a meaningful reopening growth boost in H2, which will likely
extend into 2024. As ZCP is currently still subtracting about 4-5% from the level of
GDP, we see substantial room for a cyclical rebound as immunity levels rise and most
households learn to live with the virus.
Although clearly above consensus, our Q3 and Q4 forecasts of 10% and 6% annualized
are not spectacular relative to other international reopening experiences. This is
because we expect a continued drag from Covid caution as well as other headwinds,
some cyclical and some more structural.
On the cyclical side, fiscal policy is set to tighten if the domestic economy rebounds,
and China’s pandemic-related export boom should fade as global demand for tech,
housing, and Covid-related products slows further.
On the structural side, we see the contraction of the property sector and US chip export
restrictions as multi-year drags. We estimate that the ongoing slide of the property
sector will subtract around -1½pp from growth next year as it continues to delever and
face demographic headwinds (Exhibit 19).

We recently also estimated that the new US restrictions on exports of advanced chips
(and the equipment and software to produce them) to China will subtract about ¼pp
from China growth next year and 1.7% from the 2026 level of GDP, assuming US
policymakers are serious about implementation. This reflects reduced production in
China of both chips and goods using advanced chips, such as smartphones and
computers.
The relatively muted rebound in aggregate demand—coupled with the relatively limited
rise in inflation during reopening in other Asian economies—also drives our benign
forecast for 2023 inflation and monetary policy. Specifically, we expect core CPI to pick
up only slightly from 0.7% to 1.2% next year, and the policy rate to stay flat at just 2%.
Although we do see a sharper reopening boost in 2023H2 and 2024H1 than other
forecasters, our long-run China views remain structurally below consensus (Exhibit 20).
We estimate that much of the slowdown in actual China growth in recent years
corresponds to a slowdown in potential growth to only 4.2% in 2023. We estimate that
trend growth will slow further to just above 3% over the next decade on weakness in
both demographics and productivity, and the long slide in the property market.

Pockets of Resilience in EM Early Hikers
A number of economies in Latin America as well as Central and Eastern Europe (CEE)
started hiking rates well before everyone else. Among the nine EM early hikers, the
policy rate has increased by an average of over 800bp (Exhibit 21, left panel) while our
GS Financial Conditions Index (FCI) has tightened by an average of 450bp.1 Where are
these economies headed and what can we learn from their experience for the broader
global outlook?
While no early hiker has clearly achieved a soft landing yet, activity has generally held
up better than expected. A majority of early hikers are probably still expanding, based
on GDP growth, PMIs, and labor market indicators. In particular, unemployment rates
remain low in all economies, although they have edged up in several economies
(Exhibit 21, right panel).2 We have found that elevated job openings, reopening, and
strong private sector balance sheets—again unique characteristics of this different
cycle—help explain this resilience.

Encouragingly, sequential core inflation and wage growth have begun to moderate
across most early hikers, although they remain very high. The moderation in core
inflation is most notable in Brazil, where we expect rate cuts to start in 2023Q2 and
growth to pick up back to a potential-like pace of 2% in the second half of the year
(Exhibit 22, left panel).
In contrast, the CEE economies are in a more difficult position. This reflects CEE’s
exposure to the surge in European gas prices, as well as continued high, broad, and in
the cases of Hungary and Poland still-rising inflation. We therefore expect the Czech
and Polish central banks to resume their rate hike campaigns before long (Exhibit 22,
1 We define an “early hiker” as a country under our coverage that began to increase the policy rate by
October 2021 with a cumulative increase in the first six months of at least 100bp.

close calls.

Overall, the resilience of activity in several EM early hikers so far supports our view that
the current high-inflation period does not need to end in deep recession.
Some Progress, But Still an Uncertain World
The key economic question for 2023 is whether central banks will be able to bring down
inflation to more acceptable levels without a recession, or at least without a deep
recession. We are reasonably optimistic, but there are substantial risks to our view.
One risk is that inflation pressures simply remain pervasive enough that central banks
have no choice but to keep tightening aggressively. If so, a recession might become
unavoidable, not just in Europe but also in the US. The recent news flow has reduced
this risk slightly in the US, as the labor market continues to adjust and inflation has
begun to slow. But the picture is not uniform. Central banks in Europe and those EM
economies where inflation is still increasing may be forced into further tightening in an
environment of exchange rate depreciation and rising inflation expectations.
The other main risk is that underlying inflation does come down, but central banks are
late in recognizing the improvement because they are too focused on lagging indicators
of inflation such as CPI shelter inflation. In the US, we have recently become a little less
concerned about this risk as well. Fed officials have made it clear that they are not
exclusively focused on the CPI rent numbers but also on more leading indicators such
as asking rents on new leases, which have slowed sharply in recent months. Moreover,
many central banks have either already slowed their hiking pace or signaled that they
will do so soon. This reduces the risk of overtightening as it will allow for more time to
assess the impact of higher rates on the economy.
Beyond the core inflation dynamic, we remain concerned about political and geopolitical
16 November 2022 20",pdfplumber
12,goldman_sachs_global_outlook,Unknown,Unknown,20,"Goldman Sachs Global Economics Analyst
shocks, which could affect the global economy via higher uncertainty, tighter financial
conditions, or negative effects on commodity supply. Some of these risks have
diminished slightly as well. The Italian, Brazilian, and US midterm elections have come
and gone without major market disruptions. Spreads on Italian government debt have
diminished, Brazil may be headed toward a soft landing, and there is even a possibility
that the US debt limit—arguably the biggest potential source of market disruption
emanating from DC in 2023—will be resolved in the “lame-duck” session of Congress
between now and year-end 2022. Moreover, the latest meeting between Presidents
Biden and Xi promises to defuse at least some of the tensions between the US and
China, which might also help to achieve a negotiated solution to the Russia-Ukraine war.
But there are still plenty of risks that could return us to the exceptionally volatile
environment of the first half of 2022. So far, a settlement in the Russia-Ukraine war
does not seem close at hand, and the impact of the price cap on Russian oil is
uncertain. The political instability in the Middle East—while far from a new feature of
the geopolitical order—also has the potential to deal another blow to energy markets at
a time when the supply-demand balance is already precarious. Thus, our cautiously
optimistic global economic outlook remains fraught with substantial risks.

Important Disclosure on High Yield Bonds
Unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities typically offer a higher yield than investment grade Debt Securities, but also present greater risks with respect to liquidity, volatility,
and non-payment of principal and interest. As a result of being classified as non investment grade Debt Securities, these Debt Securities present a greater degree of credit risk
relative to many other fixed income Debt Securities.
Higher Credit Risk –Unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities generally have predominantly speculative characteristics with respect to the issuer’s capacity to pay interest
and repay principal. There is greater risk of non-payment of interest and loss of principal. Many issuers of these Debt Securities have experienced substantial difficulties in servicing
their debt obligations, which has led to default and restructurings. The issuers of these Debt Securities generally have to pay a higher rate of interest than investment grade Debt
Securities.
Higher Liquidity and Secondary Market Risk –The markets in which unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities are traded aregenerally more limited than those in which
investment grade Debt Securities are traded. This lack of liquidity may make it more difficult to resell these Debt Securities and obtain market quotations.
Downgrade Risk –Downgrades in the credit rating of unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities by rating agencies are generally accompanied by declines in the market value
of these Debt Securities. In some circumstances, investors in the unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities market may anticipate such downgrades as a result of these
credits being placed on “credit watch” by rating agencies, causing volatility and speculation of further credit deterioration.
Higher Vulnerability to economic cycles -During economic downturns, unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities are typically more susceptible to price volatility and fall more
in value than investment grade Debt Securities as i) investors may reevaluate holdings in lower-quality bonds in favor of investment-grade corporate Debt Securities; ii) investors
become more risk averse; and iii) default risk rises. This is often referred to a “flight to quality”.
Event Risk –This includes any of a variety of events that can adversely affect the issuer of unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities, and therefore the issuer’s ability to meet
debt service obligations to repay principal and interest to Debt Securities holders. Event risk may pertain to the issuer specifically, the industry or business sector of the issuer, or
generally upon the overall economy. It could have a direct or indirect impact on the issuer and their outstanding debts.
Important Disclosure on RMB
Risk relating to RMB –If you choose RMB as the base currency or the alternate currency, you should also note the following:
RMB is currently not freely convertible through banks in Hong Kong. Due to exchange controls and/or restrictions imposed on the convertibility, utilization or transferability of RMB (if
any) which in turn is affected by, amongst other things, the PRC government's control, there is no guarantee that disruption in the transferability, convertibility or liquidity of RMB will
not occur. There is thus a likelihood that you may not be able to convert RMB received into other freely convertible currencies.
CNH exchange rates and CNY exchange rates are currently quoted in different markets with different exchange rates, whereby theirexchange rate movements may not be in the
same direction or magnitude. Therefore, the CNH exchange rate may be different from the CNY exchange rate.",pdfplumber

Important Disclosure on High Yield Bonds
Unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities typically offer a higher yield than investment grade Debt Securities, but also present greater risks with respect to liquidity, volatility,
and non-payment of principal and interest. As a result of being classified as non investment grade Debt Securities, these Debt Securities present a greater degree of credit risk
relative to many other fixed income Debt Securities.
Higher Credit Risk –Unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities generally have predominantly speculative characteristics with respect to the issuer’s capacity to pay interest
and repay principal. There is greater risk of non-payment of interest and loss of principal. Many issuers of these Debt Securities have experienced substantial difficulties in servicing
their debt obligations, which has led to default and restructurings. The issuers of these Debt Securities generally have to pay a higher rate of interest than investment grade Debt
Securities.
Higher Liquidity and Secondary Market Risk –The markets in which unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities are traded aregenerally more limited than those in which
investment grade Debt Securities are traded. This lack of liquidity may make it more difficult to resell these Debt Securities and obtain market quotations.
Downgrade Risk –Downgrades in the credit rating of unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities by rating agencies are generally accompanied by declines in the market value
of these Debt Securities. In some circumstances, investors in the unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities market may anticipate such downgrades as a result of these
credits being placed on “credit watch” by rating agencies, causing volatility and speculation of further credit deterioration.
Higher Vulnerability to economic cycles -During economic downturns, unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities are typically more susceptible to price volatility and fall more
in value than investment grade Debt Securities as i) investors may reevaluate holdings in lower-quality bonds in favor of investment-grade corporate Debt Securities; ii) investors
become more risk averse; and iii) default risk rises. This is often referred to a “flight to quality”.
Event Risk –This includes any of a variety of events that can adversely affect the issuer of unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities, and therefore the issuer’s ability to meet
debt service obligations to repay principal and interest to Debt Securities holders. Event risk may pertain to the issuer specifically, the industry or business sector of the issuer, or
generally upon the overall economy. It could have a direct or indirect impact on the issuer and their outstanding debts.
Important Disclosure on RMB
Risk relating to RMB –If you choose RMB as the base currency or the alternate currency, you should also note the following:
RMB is currently not freely convertible through banks in Hong Kong. Due to exchange controls and/or restrictions imposed on the convertibility, utilization or transferability of RMB (if
any) which in turn is affected by, amongst other things, the PRC government's control, there is no guarantee that disruption in the transferability, convertibility or liquidity of RMB will
not occur. There is thus a likelihood that you may not be able to convert RMB received into other freely convertible currencies.
CNH exchange rates and CNY exchange rates are currently quoted in different markets with different exchange rates, whereby theirexchange rate movements may not be in the
same direction or magnitude. Therefore, the CNH exchange rate may be different from the CNY exchange rate.",pdfplumber

• USD:Near-term forecasts are still leaning bearish USD. RoWLEIs are still turning up, while
data momentum has overtaken the US. DM Earnings Revisions Indices have all recently turned
positive, typically a bullish equity signal. This blunts the safe havenappeal of the USD. Relative
rate momentum, looking at 5y nominal US-G9 rates vs 100dMA, still favoursRoW. Excess
savings in the UK, EA and Japan are higher than in the US as a % of GDP.
• Big picture, Citi analysts still like USD lower. The convergence trade and subsequent asset

• EUR: China risks are concerning but European recovery has other supports. The 2022 terms

wages in Europe continue to trend up while excess savings remain at the highs. This also

Chinese growth. EUR arguably looks like a next best alternative to USD for reserve managers,
where USD allocations have been on downwards trends for the majority ofthe last decade.
• JPY: Citi analysts see risk that USDJPY goes sideways for the next quarter, as global
recession pricing looks vulnerable which can lead yields higher, pressuring JPY. Longer term,
Citi analysts expect a US recession in Q4 and risk of a BoJ policy shift around the same time.
The combination of a material US duration rally, and potentially higher Japanese yields, would
dramatically narrow the USD-JPY rate differential. Given uncertainty around the depth of the
US recession and signs that the US labourmarket may be stronger for longer, the 6-12m
forecast was upgraded to 125 from 120.
• AUD:Weaker China, lower commodity prices and doubtful RBA hawkishness to weigh on
AUD. Domestically, employment data showed labourmarkets slowing faster than the RBA
forecasts. This adds reasons for RBA to hold and see this summer. Citi analysts now moved
their final hike to August. Citi analysts watch closely for any meaningful support from Chinese
authorities or credit easing announcement, as a sentiment shift would be hawkish AUD and
commodity-linked FX.
• GBP: UK data improving, BoE want to pivot but data isn’t weak enough yet. The UK has
experienced a very positive terms of trade shock, and excess savings in the UK are larger than
in US or EA. This could mean that macro divergences between UK and DM peers take longer to
set in. Relative data surprise and nominal rate differentials have been a good signpost for these
trends. Both have supported the recent GBP rally on the crosses, amid fairly bearishsentiment
across the board on the UK. In the longer term, Citi anlaystsstill think that domestic fragilities
in the UK remain in the forecast horizon, which brings on balance larger risk of growth and
monetary policy divergences in favourof Europe.

Important Disclosure on High Yield Bonds
Unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities typically offer a higher yield than investment grade Debt Securities, but also present greater risks with respect to liquidity,
volatility, and non-payment of principal and interest. As a result of being classified as non investment grade Debt Securities, these Debt Securities present a greater degree of
credit risk relative to many other fixed income Debt Securities.
Higher Credit Risk –Unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities generally have predominantly speculative characteristics with respect to the issuer’s capacity to pay
interest and repay principal. There is greater risk of non-payment of interest and loss of principal. Many issuers of these DebtSecurities have experienced substantial difficulties
in servicing their debt obligations, which has led to default and restructurings. The issuers of these Debt Securities generallyhave to pay a higher rate of interest than
investment grade Debt Securities.
Higher Liquidity and Secondary Market Risk –The markets in which unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities are traded aregenerally more limited than those in which
investment grade Debt Securities are traded. This lack of liquidity may make it more difficult to resell these Debt Securities and obtain market quotations.
Downgrade Risk –Downgrades in the credit rating of unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities by rating agencies are generally accompanied by declines in the market
value of these Debt Securities. In some circumstances, investors in the unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities market may anticipate such downgrades as a result of
these credits being placed on “credit watch” by rating agencies, causing volatility and speculation of further credit deterioration.
Higher Vulnerability to economic cycles -During economic downturns, unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities are typically more susceptible to price volatility and fall
more in value than investment grade Debt Securities as i) investors may reevaluate holdings in lower-quality bonds in favor of investment-grade corporate Debt Securities; ii)
investors become more risk averse; and iii) default risk rises. This is often referred to a “flight to quality”.
Event Risk –This includes any of a variety of events that can adversely affect the issuer of unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities, and therefore the issuer’s ability to
meet debt service obligations to repay principal and interest to Debt Securities holders. Event risk may pertain to the issuer specifically, the industry or business sector of the
issuer, or generally upon the overall economy. It could have a direct or indirect impact on the issuer and their outstanding debts.
Important Disclosure on RMB
Risk relating to RMB –If you choose RMB as the base currency or the alternate currency, you should also note the following:
RMB is currently not freely convertible through banks in Hong Kong. Due to exchange controls and/or restrictions imposed on the convertibility, utilization or transferability of
RMB (if any) which in turn is affected by, amongst other things, the PRC government's control, there is no guarantee that disruption in the transferability, convertibility or
liquidity of RMB will not occur. There is thus a likelihood that you may not be able to convert RMB received into other freely convertible currencies.
CNH exchange rates and CNY exchange rates are currently quoted in different markets with different exchange rates, whereby theirexchange rate movements may not be in the
same direction or magnitude. Therefore, the CNH exchange rate may be different from the CNY exchange rate.",pdfplumber

17,kkr_global_view_2023,Unknown,Unknown,2,"Outlook for 2023:
Keep It Simple
Despite all the uncertainty across today’s global capital markets, we
are poised to enter 2023 with a more constructive tilt, especially
on many parts of Credit. Our basic premise is that it will be easier to
navigate inflation’s negative impact on corporate earnings and consumer
balance sheets in 2023 than it was to invest with inflation continually
surprising central banks and investors in 2022. However, what we are
proposing will require both patience and courage – and a game plan that
leverages the type of long-term frameworks we employ at KKR across
asset classes and regions. At its core, our message is to ‘Keep it Simple’
in 2023. The massive increase we have seen in short-term interest in
many instances has created attractive total return opportunities across
several parts of the global capital markets without having to stretch
on leverage, volatility, and/or risk. Implicit in our outlook is our strong
view that now is a good time to be a lender. As such, we continue to
lean towards collateral-based cash flows such as Infrastructure, Private
Credit, Real Estate Credit and many parts of Asset-Based Finance.
We also like some of the convexity that liquid Credit provides after the
recent sell-off. Within Equities, our advice is to shift away from larger-
capitalization Technology stocks in favor of smaller capitalization names
with better valuation profiles. History suggests that 2023 will be a good
vintage year for Private Equity. We also see the U.S. dollar’s strength
reversing, which means that many international assets need to be re-
considered. Finally, while we see the positive relationship between stocks
and bonds easing in 2023, our longer-term view remains that we have
entered a regime change that requires a different approach to overall
global macro and asset allocation.
Truth is ever to be found in the simplicity, and
not in the multiplicity and confusion of things.
—Isaac Newton, English mathematician and physicist

17,kkr_global_view_2023,Unknown,Unknown,3,"With a higher resting heart rate for inflation amidst record stimu-
lus, we have been cautioning for some time that we see a ’dif-
ferent kind of recovery‘, and that investors should ‘walk, not run’
when it comes to deployment, especially as the correlation be-
tween stocks and bonds turned positive. No doubt, we still think
the macro environment remains challenging, but we now feel
more emboldened as we think about deployment entering 2023.
Key to our thinking are the following considerations
1 Global central banks are much further along in their tightening campaign, As Chairman Powell said
recently, rates are ‘getting close’ to sufficiently restrictive levels. Our work shows that the share of the top
25 central banks boosting rates will fall to 12% in 2023, compared to fully 84% in 2022. This decline is an
important one to consider, we believe. We also think the chance of the U.S. dollar bull market continuing
well into 2023 is now much more limited. This macro consideration is a big deal, in our view
2
United States inflation has peaked, though it remains quite high. In fact, with this publication, we just
tweaked our inflation forecast lower for the first time in almost two years. See below for more detail, but a
‘tug of war’ between falling housing prices and rising labor costs now better reflects the Fed’s intentions
to cool the economy.
3
Capital markets new supply (i.e., new issuance), which we track closely as a proxy for calling
bottoms, has dwindled essentially to nothing. In the United States, for example, we measure that it is
now approaching the lows we saw in 2009, especially when one adjusts for the growth in GDP since then
(Exhibit 1).
A more visible hand: We think government spending will quietly surprise on the upside in 2023. Our
travels to major political hubs such as Washington DC, Paris, and Tokyo of late lead us to believe that key
4
initiatives like the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA, which we think could be closer to $700 billion versus the
‘headline’ of $370 billion) and EU Recovery Budget (€1.8 trillion over 2020-2026) will result in more
spending than many folks think. Meanwhile, spending on military budgets is increasing around the world,
as geopolitics is no longer a discretionary line item in most government budgets these days. Finally, in
China, for example, our local research leads us to believe that further stimulus is gaining momentum to
offset the headwinds created by recent property developer defaults.
The technical picture is actually quite compelling. Many allocators have de-risked their portfolios,
5 especially allocators who likely over-emphasized the stability provided by bonds as we transitioned from
QE to QT. We also take comfort that the S&P 500 has already corrected 25%, an important ‘lean in’ signal
based on history, as well as that most High Yield bonds now trade at 85 cents on the dollar, another signal
that one should add back some risks to a diversified portfolio. Importantly, our view is that the massive
adjustment in the risk-free rate, not necessarily a record widening of credit spreads, will be what is
remembered about the opportunity set created during this tightening cycle.

Services inflation appears to be stabilizing, albeit at levels that remain much too high. Importantly, within
Services, shelter inflation is in the process of peaking, we believe.
3
Labor costs are the single most inflationary input into our KKR Core CPI indicator. While we think that
overall inflation has likely peaked, the combination of higher incomes and a higher tolerance for inflation
raises the risk of periodic re-accelerations in CPI over the course of this cycle.
4
Corporate margins will remain under pressure in 2023. The reality of higher labor costs amidst slowing
nominal GDP will create a backdrop that further dents margins for businesses.
Bottom line: We now have greater conviction that core inflation has peaked, which diminishes the odds of a worst-case
scenario when it comes to peak fed funds. At the same time, we continue to be guards-up about earnings as wage growth
rises above CPI inflation and goods prices turn negative year-over-year. Said differently, the focus is shifting from ‘how
high inflation goes in 2022’ to ‘how high inflation stays in 2023 and beyond’, meaning that defendable margins are
becoming more important as price growth cools heading into next year.

Key Euro Area GDP Takeaways
1
We expect high energy costs to curtail household purchasing power as well as force some manufacturers
to curb production. However, fiscal support should provide some cushion.
2
Tighter financial conditions will likely be a drag on business investment. Weaker global demand could hurt
export growth for Europe in 2023 despite a weak euro.
3
Uncertainty around gas supply is the key downside risk to GDP. Further disruption to gas markets
(e.g., adverse weather conditions or a complete halting of Russian gas flows) puts GDP and our mild
manageable recession forecast at risk. In this scenario, we model a more severe recession lasting into
1Q24, with a peak to trough fall in GDP of 2.5%.
4
Our bull case is based on the assumption of a gradual relaxation of tension in global energy markets and
easing inflation concerns, leading to Eurozone GDP growth in 2023 of 1.5%.
5
We expect labor markets to remain more resilient than in previous crises due to structural tightness in
labor supply and consequent reluctance of employers to cut workers.
Bottom line: We believe investors should plan for the Eurozone economy to contract by 0.2% over the next twelve months
before entering a period of moderate recovery, with growth of 1.6% in 2024.

Many factors weighing on China have reached peak pain and should begin to improve from here, including
an exit path from zero-COVID and less of a drag from the property market (-0.5 ppt in 2023 vs. -2.9 ppt in
2022) now that the Authorities have stepped in.

Consumption should also begin to improve from near record low levels, as mobility increases (retail sales
are currently 12% below trend).
3
In Japan, valuations are attractive (30% of companies trading below book value) on a long-term structural
basis and the economy is about half way through the growth slowdown. The weak yen has improved
competitiveness for Japanese products and services. Despite the recent strengthening, the yen is still
extremely cheap at 40% below its average real effective exchange rate.

From a valuation perspective, Asia looks attractive as P/E is down approximately 60% vs. ‘just’ 40% in the

Base Case 4.88% 4.125% 3.38% 3.13% • In our base case, the Fed continues to hike rates
(55% through mid-year 2023, peaking just above five
chance) percent and ending the year slightly lower in the
high four percent range.
• In 2024 and 2025, the Fed has room to cut
rates modestly in response to falling inflation
and motivation to do so from a housing-market
slowdown, but policymakers still ride the brake
with a higher ‘neutral’ rate for fed funds at
3.125% in 2026 and beyond.

economic backdrop softens.
• Ultimately, the Fed hikes too far in a slowing GDP
environment and is forced to cut aggressively in
2024 as financial/ economic conditions worsen
and home prices turn over.
Low Case 2.88% 2.13% 1.88% 1.13% • We assume a worsening recession that cools
(10% inflation significantly by the end of 2023, with
chance) services activity falling along with goods.
• In this case, we are wrong about a ‘different kind
of cycle’ and return to an environment of secular
stagnation, with the Fed chasing nominal GDP

High Case 5.63% 5.63% 5.13% 4.88% • Similar to the overshoot case, inflation/
(20% employment pick back up next year, and the Fed
chance) continues to hike aggressively in 2023 to prevent
a wage-price spiral.
• Unlike the overshoot case, the housing market
proves resilient to higher rates and we avoid a
severe recession, meaning the Fed holds rates
much higher than markets expect both in the near
and long run to control very sticky inflation.

17,kkr_global_view_2023,Unknown,Unknown,68,"60/40 Portfolio: Key Investing Conclusions
1
While the 60/40 portfolio could snap back in the short-term, our fundamental, long-term view that the
correlation between Equities and Bonds has turned positive has not changed. As such, we think we are in
a different regime for asset allocation.
2
We reiterate our view that a 40/30/30 Equities-Bonds-Alternatives allocation offers more robustness
around diversification and inflation protection for the macroeconomic environment ahead. In the follow-up
to our May 2022 portfolio construction paper, we examine our suggested 10% allocation to Private Credit.
3
We think that the case for Private Credit is actually more compelling today than when we wrote our
original piece in May 2022. This asset class is benefitting from traditional lenders being sidelined, as
capital charges mount amidst a large amount of ‘hung’ loans. We also see improved lending terms, higher
absolute rates, and larger companies.
4
While building this 10% Private Credit allocation (which in general takes a few years) we propose
investors pay attention to the current value offered in traded credit. We see some compelling relative value
in CLO liabilities for example, which can be used as a bridge to get to the 10% Private Credit allocation.
5
Institutional and individual investors may look for different ways to implement our views. Draw-down
funds remain compelling options for institutions and high net worth individuals, but we also see some
compelling tactical opportunities across BDCs, interval funds, and even some high quality ETFs.
So, as we look ahead, we think that long-term investors they occur. As numerous studies have shown and as we

Important Disclosure on High Yield Bonds
Unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities typically offer a higher yield than investment grade Debt Securities, but also present greater risks with respect to liquidity, volatility,
and non-payment of principal and interest. As a result of being classified as non investment grade Debt Securities, these Debt Securities present a greater degree of credit risk
relative to many other fixed income Debt Securities.
Higher Credit Risk –Unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities generally have predominantly speculative characteristics with respect to the issuer’s capacity to pay interest
and repay principal. There is greater risk of non-payment of interest and loss of principal. Many issuers of these Debt Securities have experienced substantial difficulties in servicing
their debt obligations, which has led to default and restructurings. The issuers of these Debt Securities generally have to pay a higher rate of interest than investment grade Debt
Securities.
Higher Liquidity and Secondary Market Risk –The markets in which unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities are traded aregenerally more limited than those in which
investment grade Debt Securities are traded. This lack of liquidity may make it more difficult to resell these Debt Securities and obtain market quotations.
Downgrade Risk –Downgrades in the credit rating of unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities by rating agencies are generally accompanied by declines in the market value
of these Debt Securities. In some circumstances, investors in the unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities market may anticipate such downgrades as a result of these
credits being placed on “credit watch” by rating agencies, causing volatility and speculation of further credit deterioration.
Higher Vulnerability to economic cycles -During economic downturns, unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities are typically more susceptible to price volatility and fall more
in value than investment grade Debt Securities as i) investors may reevaluate holdings in lower-quality bonds in favor of investment-grade corporate Debt Securities; ii) investors
become more risk averse; and iii) default risk rises. This is often referred to a “flight to quality”.
Event Risk –This includes any of a variety of events that can adversely affect the issuer of unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities, and therefore the issuer’s ability to meet
debt service obligations to repay principal and interest to Debt Securities holders. Event risk may pertain to the issuer specifically, the industry or business sector of the issuer, or
generally upon the overall economy. It could have a direct or indirect impact on the issuer and their outstanding debts.
Important Disclosure on RMB
Risk relating to RMB –If you choose RMB as the base currency or the alternate currency, you should also note the following:
RMB is currently not freely convertible through banks in Hong Kong. Due to exchange controls and/or restrictions imposed on the convertibility, utilization or transferability of RMB (if
any) which in turn is affected by, amongst other things, the PRC government's control, there is no guarantee that disruption in the transferability, convertibility or liquidity of RMB will
not occur. There is thus a likelihood that you may not be able to convert RMB received into other freely convertible currencies.
CNH exchange rates and CNY exchange rates are currently quoted in different markets with different exchange rates, whereby theirexchange rate movements may not be in the
same direction or magnitude. Therefore, the CNH exchange rate may be different from the CNY exchange rate.",pdfplumber

Important Disclosure on High Yield Bonds
Unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities typically offer a higher yield than investment grade Debt Securities, but also present greater risks with respect to liquidity,
volatility, and non-payment of principal and interest. As a result of being classified as non investment grade Debt Securities, these Debt Securities present a greater degree of
credit risk relative to many other fixed income Debt Securities.
Higher Credit Risk –Unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities generally have predominantly speculative characteristics with respect to the issuer’s capacity to pay
interest and repay principal. There is greater risk of non-payment of interest and loss of principal. Many issuers of these DebtSecurities have experienced substantial difficulties
in servicing their debt obligations, which has led to default and restructurings. The issuers of these Debt Securities generallyhave to pay a higher rate of interest than
investment grade Debt Securities.
Higher Liquidity and Secondary Market Risk –The markets in which unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities are traded aregenerally more limited than those in which
investment grade Debt Securities are traded. This lack of liquidity may make it more difficult to resell these Debt Securities and obtain market quotations.
Downgrade Risk –Downgrades in the credit rating of unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities by rating agencies are generally accompanied by declines in the market
value of these Debt Securities. In some circumstances, investors in the unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities market may anticipate such downgrades as a result of
these credits being placed on “credit watch” by rating agencies, causing volatility and speculation of further credit deterioration.
Higher Vulnerability to economic cycles -During economic downturns, unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities are typically more susceptible to price volatility and fall
more in value than investment grade Debt Securities as i) investors may reevaluate holdings in lower-quality bonds in favor of investment-grade corporate Debt Securities; ii)
investors become more risk averse; and iii) default risk rises. This is often referred to a “flight to quality”.
Event Risk –This includes any of a variety of events that can adversely affect the issuer of unrated or non investment grade Debt Securities, and therefore the issuer’s ability to
meet debt service obligations to repay principal and interest to Debt Securities holders. Event risk may pertain to the issuer specifically, the industry or business sector of the
issuer, or generally upon the overall economy. It could have a direct or indirect impact on the issuer and their outstanding debts.
Important Disclosure on RMB
Risk relating to RMB –If you choose RMB as the base currency or the alternate currency, you should also note the following:
RMB is currently not freely convertible through banks in Hong Kong. Due to exchange controls and/or restrictions imposed on the convertibility, utilization or transferability of
RMB (if any) which in turn is affected by, amongst other things, the PRC government's control, there is no guarantee that disruption in the transferability, convertibility or
liquidity of RMB will not occur. There is thus a likelihood that you may not be able to convert RMB received into other freely convertible currencies.
CNH exchange rates and CNY exchange rates are currently quoted in different markets with different exchange rates, whereby theirexchange rate movements may not be in the
same direction or magnitude. Therefore, the CNH exchange rate may be different from the CNY exchange rate.",pdfplumber
